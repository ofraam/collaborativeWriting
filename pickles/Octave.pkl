VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated to 8ve) is the interval between one musical note and another whose pitch is twice its frequency. For example, if one note is pitched at 400Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.\u000aIt is the most fundamental interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same".\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated to 8ve) is the interval between one musical note and another whose pitch is twice its frequency. For example, if one note is pitched at 400Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. \u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aThe octave is the most fundamental interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the western system of music notation - the name of a note an octave above A is also A.\u000aIn music notation, 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning for "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava basso) is more common.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated to 8ve) is the interval between one musical note and another whose pitch is twice its frequency. For example, if one note is pitched at 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.

For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation - the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency and in some ways is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.

V\u000a: For the numerical computation software, see GNU Octave.\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note is pitched at 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.\u000aThe octave is the second simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is in some ways is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart.

For example, if one note is pitched at 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occure at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away form 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aThe octave is the second simplest interval in music (after the unison). The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart.

V: For other uses of the word octave, see Octave (disambiguation).\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note is pitched at 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aThe octave is the second simplest interval in music (after the unison). The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma means "play two octaves higher than written." Coll'ottava means to play the passage in octaves. Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\u000aFor music-theoretical purposes (not on sheet music), octave can be abbreviated as P8.\u000a{| id="toc" style="margin: 0 2em 0 2em;"\u000a! colspan="7" style="background:#ccccff" | Octave\u000a|-\u000a! # semitones\u000a!

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency (pitch is the primary psychological correlate of frequency) of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, octave may also means a special effect, involving play two notes that are an ioctave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be conduct purposely. However, some instruments are purposely tuned/created to produce such effect, such as twelve-string guitar, octave harmonica, etc.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

V: For other uses of the word octave, see Octave (disambiguation).\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aThe octave is the second simplest interval in music (after the unison). The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively, however 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave, the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G\u042c is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of +/-6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by +/-6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of +/-6dB per octave is equivalent to +/-20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, not counting both ends. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (1/2^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (\u005cfrac{1}{2}^1) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of 6dB per octave is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aIn the Electrical Sense 6 db per octave is actually equal to 19.93157, which is almost 20.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Coll'ottava means to play the passage in octaves. Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\u000aFor music-theoretical purposes (not on sheet music), octave can be abbreviated as P8.\u000ahttp://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okt%C3%A1va_%28hudba%29\u000a

For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (2^{-1}) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (2^{-1}) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to the concept of harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter two of which are generally used only in musical set theory or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). Also monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm].\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of 6dB per octave is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aIn the Electrical Sense 6 db per octave is actually equal to 19.93157, which is almost 20.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double the frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (2^{-1}) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (2^{-1}) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or 8va) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (2^{-1}) and 4 (2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of 6dB per octave is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aIn the Electrical Sense 6 db per octave is actually equal to 19.93157 per decade, which is almost 20.\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from Italian for 8. In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has 7 1/3 octaves total.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of 6dB per octave is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aIn the Electrical Sense 6 db per octave is actually equal to 19.93157 per decade, which is almost 20.\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart.

Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means to play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notatated octaves. Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  A frequency response of 6dB per octave is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aIn the Electrical Sense 6 db per octave is actually equal to 19.93157 per decade, which is almost 20.\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has 7 1/3 octaves total.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\u000aFor music-theoretical purposes (not on sheet music), octave can be abbreviated as P8.\u000a

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000a of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). DIIIIIEEEE-ANNNNEEE  However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of two in voltage, or more precisely 6.0206 decibels) when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has 7 1/3 octaves total.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same".

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of two in voltage, or more precisely 6.0206 decibels) when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aThis was discovered by Joshua Villela who was also famous for inventing penis up the bum\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the voltage gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of two in voltage, or more precisely 6.0206 decibels) when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has 7 1/3 octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually 16/8, which produces a 2/1 octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common.

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

V In music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

VWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C#s, or all 1s (if C=0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G natural to G# (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G natural to G-flat (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has 7 1/3 octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually 16/8, which produces a 2/1 octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave. Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical note and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff#REDIRECT }hxgvvvvvhvhyydavgvsdMedia:Example.oggFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hzbut this is not always accurate the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2^n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are \u005cfrac{1}{2} (or 2^{-1}) and 4 (or 2^2) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz., and the actual number would be 150 Hz.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8ve or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are 1/2 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.

VIn music, an octave (sometimes abbreviated 8va or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, sometimes abbreviated 8va, 8vo, or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. \u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct').

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, sometimes abbreviated 8va (an octave above the indicated note(s), 8vo (an octave below), or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave, "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means "play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves". Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\u000aFor music-theoretical purposes (not on sheet music), octave can be abbreviated as P8 (which is an abbreviation for Perfect Eighth, the interval between 12 semitones or an octave).\u000a

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, sometimes abbreviated 8va (an octave above the indicated note(s), 8vo (an octave below), or P8) is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave, "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct').

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave, "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb.  To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.

Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means "play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves". Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word loco, but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\u000aFor music-theoretical purposes (not on sheet music), octave can be abbreviated as P8 (which is an abbreviation for Perfect Eighth, the interval between 12 semitones or an octave).\u000a* Eight foot pitch\u000a* Pseudo-octave\u000a* Pythagorean interval\u000a* Solfege\u000a*Burns, Edward M.

VFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb.  To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.

Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb.  To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A.

Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

VFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave, "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is, "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb.  To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation&mdash;the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics.  This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).  The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.  This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave.  What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.  This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb.  To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.

Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962).

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2.

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000adespite popular beliefe, an octave is JUST 400Hz DIFFERENCE.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave. What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, this is 8 notes if one counts both ends, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). In the chromatic scale, this is 13 notes counting both ends, although traditionally, one speaks of 12 notes of the chromatic scale, since there are 12 intervals. Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

VWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.

V\u000aIn music, an octave Fancies Jack Grandma. (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."(Cooper 1973, p.16)\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain [http://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8).

VFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music (e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs & Kunst, 1962). However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brainhttp://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes (Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg 2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship" is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.. However, monkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brainhttp://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006). ''Classical Music, Why Bother?". Routledge. ISBN 041597173X. Cites Bharucha (2003)..\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave. What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range. This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common.

VWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.

VIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship" is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same". For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, and is closely related to harmonics. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J.

VFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, "the assumption that tones separated by an octave are in many ways musically equivalent and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most musics, but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (, is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave "relationship" is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the 'basic miracle of music,'" the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brainhttp://web.telia.com/~u57011259/eng7.htm and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006). ''Classical Music, Why Bother?". Routledge. ISBN 041597173X. Cites Bharucha (2003).. Studies have also shown the perception of octave equivalence in rats (Blackwell & Schlosberg, 1943), human infants (Demany & Armand, 1984), and musicians (Allen, 1967) but not starlings (Cynx, 1993), 4-9 year old children (Sergeant, 1983), or nonmusicians (Allen, 1967).\u000aWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).\u000aExample\u000aA magnitude of 400 (52 dB) at 4 kHz decreases as frequency increases at &minus;2 dB/octave. What is the magnitude at 13 kHz?\u000a: \u005ctext{number of octaves} = \u005clog_2\u005cleft(\u005cfrac{13}{4}\u005cright) = 1.7\u000a: \u005ctext{Mag}_{13\u005ctext{ kHz}} = 52\u005ctext{ dB} + (1.7\u005ctext{ octaves} \u005ctimes -2\u005ctext{ dB/octave}) = 48.6\u005ctext{ dB} = 269.\u005c,\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning). These semitones are usually equally spaced out in a method known as equal temperament.\u000aMany times singers will be described as having a four-octave range or a five-octave range. This is technically a misnomer, and is described here: five-octave vocal range. It is important to remember when hearing this description that a piano has  octaves total.\u000aMany of the dual toned sirens manufactured by the Sentry Siren Company use an octave ratio on their sirens, usually  octave.\u000aThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means "play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves".

Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217.

''Classical Music, Why Bother?". Routledge. ISBN 041597173X. Cites Bharucha (2003).. Studies have also shown the perception of octave equivalence in rats (Blackwell & Schlosberg, 1943), human infants (Demany & Armand, 1984), and musicians (Allen, 1967) but not starlings (Cynx, 1993), 4-9 year old children (Sergeant, 1983), or nonmusicians (Allen, 1967).

VWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.

VIn electronics design, an amplifier or filter may be stated to have a frequency response of 6dB per octave over a particular frequency range, which signifies that the power gain changes by 6 decibels (a factor of four in power), or more precisely 6.0206 decibels when the frequency changes by a factor of 2. This response is equivalent to 20dB per decade (a change in frequency by a factor of 10).

Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most Western music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217.

V\u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician. However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most classical music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.

V\u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain[http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm The mechanism of octave circularity in the auditory brain] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006).

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

VAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways "and that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used.

V\u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU, P4, and P5.\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.

Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  Using notes, this would be the same note up or down 12 semi-tones on the chromatic scale.  For example, an A4 note would be one octave lower than an A5 note, and one octave higher than an A3 note.  The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave is occasionally referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics. For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time.

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight").

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  Using notes, this would be the same note up or down 12 semi-tones on the chromatic scale.  For example, an A4 note would be one octave lower than an A5 note, and one octave higher than an A3 note.  The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A.

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.

(all' ottava: "at the octave") 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written."

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  Using notes, this would be the same note up or down 12 semi-tones on the chromatic scale.  For example, an A4 note would be one octave lower than an A5 note, and one octave higher than an A3 note.  The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.

VThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written." (all' ottava: "at the octave") 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (note the 8 and the word 'oct'). Sometimes 8va will also be used to indicate a passage is to be played an octave lower, although the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means "play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves".

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  Using notes, this would be the same note up or down 12 semi-tones on the chromatic scale.  For example, an A4 note would be one octave lower than an A5 note, and one octave higher than an A3 note.  The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aass muncher poodle pussy shit hick ass wiped retarded camel if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000a i like to eat the pussy and after i eat it i use my fornication stick to fuck it After the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight").

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency.  Using notes, this would be the same note up or down 12 semi-tones on the chromatic scale.  For example, an A4 note would be one octave lower than an A5 note, and one octave higher than an A3 note.  The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon which has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a more preferable enharmonic notation available, but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\u000aAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes that are an octave apart at the same time. This effect may have to be created by the musician (see Wes Montgomery). However, some instruments are purposely tuned or designed to produce this effect, for example, the twelve-string guitar and the octave harmonica.\u000aIn most classical music, the octave is divided into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

Vframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800 Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200 Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50 Hz and 400 Hz are one and two octaves away from 100 Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300 Hz is not a whole number octave above 100 Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50&nbsp;Hz and 400&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 100&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. However, 300&nbsp;Hz is not a whole number octave above 100&nbsp;Hz, despite being a harmonic of 100 Hz.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50&nbsp;Hz and 400&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 100&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

Vframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5For example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50&nbsp;Hz and 400&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 100&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. thumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. After the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory. The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217.

V\u000athumb|right|Perfect octave \u000aIn music, an octave () is the interval between El Cid one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics. However being thee thou ye not El Cid so be yes.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50&nbsp;Hz and 400&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 100&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M.

The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class. Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.\u000aIn terms of playing an instrument, "octave" may also mean a special effect involving playing two notes an octave apart at the same time.  Some instruments innately provide octaves by having double strings, reeds, etc.&mdash;as in the twelve-string guitar or octave harmonica.\u000aMost classical music systems divide the octave into 12 semitones (see musical tuning).

VAs well as being used to describe the relationship between two notes, the word is also used when speaking of a range of notes that fall between a pair an octave apart. In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.

The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music," the use of which is "common in most musical systems."Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 400 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 800&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 200&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 50&nbsp;Hz and 400&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 100&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight"). Other scales may have a different number of notes covering the range of an octave, such as the chromatic scale with 12 notes or Arabic classical scale with 17, 19, or even 24 notes, but the word "octave" is still used in English.

The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M.

Octave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962).

In the diatonic scale, and the other standard heptatonic scales of Western music, there are 7 notes; if one counts both ends (see Fencepost error) there are 8 notes, hence the name "octave", from the Latin octavus, from octo (meaning "eight").

It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aThe octave above an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va, and the octave below 8vb. To emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals, the octave is sometimes called perfect octave, and designated P8; the other perfect intervals, the unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth, are designated PU (or P1), P4, and P5.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A.

V\u000aIn music, an octave () or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va or 8vb, respectively.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

V\u000aIn music, an octave () or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va or 8vb, respectively.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4.  The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217.\u000aThe languages in which the oldest extant written documents on tuning are written, Sumerian and Akkadian, have no known word for "octave". However, it is believed that a set of cuneiform tablets that collectively describe the tuning of a nine-stringed instrument, believed to be a Babylonian lyre, describe tunings for seven of the strings, with indications to tune the remaining two strings an octave from two of the seven tuned strings.\u000aLeon Crickmore recently proposed that "The octave may not have been thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day week".\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled at fifths: fairly consonant but not equivalent. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain[http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm The mechanism of octave circularity in the auditory brain] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes.Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave () or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va (= Italian all'ottava), or 8va bassa (= Italian all'ottava bassa, sometimes also 8vb), respectively.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M.

The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J.

However, it is believed that a set of cuneiform tablets that collectively describe the tuning of a nine-stringed instrument, believed to be a Babylonian lyre, describe tunings for seven of the strings, with indications to tune the remaining two strings an octave from two of the seven tuned strings.\u000aLeon Crickmore recently proposed that "The octave may not have been thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day week".\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled at fifths: fairly consonant but not equivalent. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain[http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm The mechanism of octave circularity in the auditory brain] and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes.Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006).

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are  (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. thumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (Latin octavus: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va (= Italian all'ottava), or 8va bassa (= Italian all'ottava bassa, sometimes also 8vb), respectively.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are 0.5 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4.  The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

V\u000aIn music, an octave (Latin octavus: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va (= Italian all'ottava), or 8va bassa (= Italian all'ottava bassa, sometimes also 8vb), respectively.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are 0.5 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4.  The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

VThe notation 8va is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning "play this an octave higher than written" (all' ottava: "at the octave"). 8va stands for ottava, the Italian word for octave (also meaning "eighth"). Sometimes 8va is used to tell the musician to play a passage an octave lower, though the similar notation 8vb (ottava bassa) is more common. Similarly, 15ma (quindicesima) means "play two octaves higher than written" and 15mb (quindicesima bassa) means "play two octaves lower than written." Col 8 or c. 8va stands for coll'ottava and means "play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves".

V\u000aIn music, an octave (Latin octavus: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va (= Italian all'ottava), 8va bassa (= Italian all'ottava bassa, sometimes also 8vb), or simply 8 for the octave above.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are 0.5 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4.  The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M.

However, it is believed that a set of cuneiform tablets that collectively describe the tuning of a nine-stringed instrument, believed to be a Babylonian lyre, describe tunings for seven of the strings, with indications to tune the remaining two strings an octave from two of the seven tuned strings.\u000aLeon Crickmore recently proposed that "The octave may not have been thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day week".\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled at fifths: fairly consonant but not equivalent. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain"[http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm The mechanism of octave circularity in the auditory brain]", Neuroscience of Music. and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes.Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006).

V\u000aIn music, an octave (Latin octavus: eighth) or perfect octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with half or double its frequency. The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the "basic miracle of music", the use of which is "common in most musical systems".Cooper, Paul (1973). Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach, p.16. ISBN 0-396-06752-2. It may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the first and second harmonics.\u000aThe octave has occasionally been referred to as a diapason.\u000aTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated 8va (= Italian all'ottava), 8va bassa (= Italian all'ottava bassa, sometimes also 8vb), or simply 8 for the octave in the direction indicated by placing this mark above or below the staff.\u000aframe|left|An example of an octave, from G4 to G5\u000aFor example, if one note has a frequency of 440 Hz, the note an octave above it is at 880&nbsp;Hz, and the note an octave below is at 220&nbsp;Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are 0.5 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively. \u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave "ring" together, adding a pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4.  The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all Cs, or all 1s (if C&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), in any octave are part of the same pitch class.\u000aOctave equivalency is a part of most "advanced musical cultures", but is far from universal in "primitive" and early music.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). In The wellsprings of music, ed. Kunst, J. The Hague: Marinus Nijhoff.e.g., Nettl, 1956; Sachs, C. and Kunst, J. (1962). Cited in Burns, Edward M. (1999), p.217.\u000aThe languages in which the oldest extant written documents on tuning are written, Sumerian and Akkadian, have no known word for "octave". However, it is believed that a set of cuneiform tablets that collectively describe the tuning of a nine-stringed instrument, believed to be a Babylonian lyre, describe tunings for seven of the strings, with indications to tune the remaining two strings an octave from two of the seven tuned strings.\u000aLeon Crickmore recently proposed that "The octave may not have been thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day week".\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled at fifths: fairly consonant but not equivalent. \u000aMonkeys experience octave equivalency, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain"[http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm The mechanism of octave circularity in the auditory brain]", Neuroscience of Music. and the perception of octave equivalency in self-organizing neural networks can form through exposure to pitched notes, without any tutoring, this being derived from the acoustical structure of those notes.Bharucha 2003, cited in Fineberg, Joshua (2006).

Further octaves of a note occur at 2n times the frequency of that note (where n is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55&nbsp;Hz and 440&nbsp;Hz are one and two octaves away from 110&nbsp;Hz because they are 0.5 (or 2&nbsp;&minus;1) and 4 (or 22) times the frequency, respectively.\u000athumb|right|350px|"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" melody doubled in four octaves: consonant and equivalent. \u000aAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music.

The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1.

A Russian bass can also sing in this range, and the fundamental pitches sung by Tibetan monks and the throat singers of Siberia and Mongolia are in this range.
