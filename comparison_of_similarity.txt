The real reason is that we became profitable in the first quarter of 2001 because Sergey Brin made it a priority. You see, Sergey would try to go out on dates. He would call up women. And to impress them he would say, \'I\'m the president of a money-losing dot-com.\' But in Palo Alto in 2000, a huge number of people were presidents of money-losing dot-coms. And so they would not call him back. And he thought, \'If only I were president of a money-making dot-com, things would be very different...\'"Larry Page: We missed both things.

Google\'s corporate headquarters is at the "Googleplex" in Mountain View, California, and employs over 4,000 workers. Dr. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Novell, was named the Chief Executive Officer when co-founder Larry Page stepped down. thumb|right|300px|Screenshot of Google LogoGoogle began as a research project in early 1996 by Larry Page   and Sergey Brin, two Ph.D. students at Stanford.  They developed the hypothesis that a search engine based on analysis of the relationships between Web sites would produce improved results over the basic techniques then in use. It was originally nicknamed BackRub because the system checked backlinks to estimate a site\'s importance. (A small search engine called RankDex was already exploring a similar strategy.)Convinced that the pages with the most links to them from other highly relevant Web pages must be the most relevant pages associated with the search, Page and Brin tested their thesis as part of their studies, and laid the foundation for their search engine. The domain www.google.com was registered on September 15 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google, Inc., on September 7 1998 at a friend\'s garage in Menlo Park, California. In February 1999, the company moved into offices at 165 University Avenue in Palo Alto, home to a number of other noted Silicon Valley technology startups.  Google received a big break in 1999 when one of the most popular search engines, Altavista, relaunched itself as a user Web entry point, or portal.   This unexpected change alienated part of Altavista\'s user base. Google quickly outgrew its University Avenue home.  After outgrowing two subsequent sites, the company settled into a complex of buildings (known by some as "The Googleplex") in Mountain View at 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, in 2003.', 'At its peak in early 2004, Google handled upwards of 80 percent of all search requests on the world wide web through its Web site and through its partnerships with other internet clients like Yahoo!, AOL, and CNN.[http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox21.html]  In February 2004 Yahoo! dropped its partnership with Google in order to provide users at its site independent search results and to maintain their loyalty.

[('Apples have long been considered healthy, as indicated by the proverb an apple a day keeps the doctor away. In practice apples have been proven to reduce the risk of colon cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. They can also help with heart disease, weight loss and controlling cholesterol. A group of chemicals in apples could protect the brain from the type of damage that triggers such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer\'s and Parkinsonism. Chang Y. "Cy" Lee of Cornell University found was that the apple phenolics, which are naturally occurring antioxidants found in fresh apples, can protect nerve cells from neurotoxicity induced by oxidative stress. The researchers used red delicious apples grown in New York state to provide the extracts to study the effects of phytochemicals. Lee said that all apples are high in the critical phytonutrients and that the amount of phenolic compounds in the apple flesh and in the skin vary from year to year, season to season and from growing region to growing region. (November/December 2004 issue of the Journal of Food Science)Apples appear in many religious traditions. In some cultures, the apple is a symbol of immortality, love, or sexuality. The Greek hero Heracles had to find the Hesperides\' golden apples as one of his Twelve Labours. Another Greek mythological figure, Paris, had to give a golden apple inscibed Kallisti &#8211; "For the most beautiful one", or "To the Prettiest One" &#8211; (which had come from the goddess of discord, Eris) to the most beautiful goddess, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War. Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, was distracted during a race by three golden apples thrown for that purpose by a suitor, Hippomenes. In ancient Greece, throwing an apple at a person\'s bed was an invitation for sexual intercourse. Another instance in Roman and Greek is the story of the Pleiades.', 'Apples can be canned, juiced, and optionally fermented to produce apple juice, cider, vinegar, and pectin. Distilled apple cider produces the spirits applejack and Calvados. Apples are an important ingredient in many winter desserts, for example apple pie, apple crumble and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and they can also be dried and eaten or re-consitituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. Pur\xc3\xa9ed apples are generally known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used cooked in meat dishes.'), ("The following is a list of common cultivars and where they are grown.

Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia and especially India. Tastes in apples vary from one person to another and have changed over time. As an example, the U.S. state of Washington made its reputation for apple growing on Red Delicious. In recent years, many American apple connoisseurs have come to regard Red Delicious as inferior to varieties such as Fuji and Gala due to the mild flavor and soft texture of the Red Delicious.", 'Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year.')],

Years later, Davis would visit Bacall backstage to congratulate her on her performance of Margo Channing in Applause, a musical based on Davis\'s turn in All About Eve. Bacall began to model part-time. This was when she experienced anti-Semitism for the first time. Later, when she first went to Hollywood, she noticed that director Howard Hawks would make anti-Semitic remarks. This made her nervous of revealing her identity and she did not let Hawks know at the time that she was Jewish, a decision she now regrets.

After Howard Hawks\' wife (nicknamed "Slim") spotted Bacall on the cover of Harper\'s Bazaar, she showed the photo to her husband, and he then made a phone call to New York to bring her to Hollywood for a screen test.

After the filming of The African Queen in 1951, Bacall and Bogart became great friends of Bogart\'s co-star Katharine Hepburn and her partner Spencer Tracy. Bacall also began to mix in non-acting circles, becoming friends with the historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and the journalist Alistair Cooke.

[('Antony returned to Rome to deal with this new threat, but 2 of his own 5 legions on the way from Macedonia to Gaul deserted him to Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s growing army. Rather than risk a war in Italy, Antony rushed back to Cisalpine Gaul with the forces he could muster, where he hoped to seize control from Brutus. At this point, there were three seemingly opposed factions vying for power, the \xe2\x80\x98Liberators\xe2\x80\x99 or Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s assassins, Antony and Octavian. The Senate, and Cicero in particular, all viewed Antony as the greatest threat to Republican liberty, and he began a campaign of disgracing Antony through the use of his vaunted rhetoric. Viewing Octavian as a tool to be manipulated, the Senate accepted him as a counterforce to Antony\xe2\x80\x99s strength and legitimized his command, despite its illegal beginnings. Like all those before them, the Senate underestimated Octavian. Through Cicero, Octavian managed to have Antony\xe2\x80\x99s consulship stripped of him in his absence and through force of the Macedonian Legions under Marcus Agrippa, had himself placed as Consul. By the close of 44 BC, the various factions continued to shore up their military positions, and war was once again on the horizon.', 'As a result of a new agreement between them, the Pact of Brundisium, both men confirmed the situation as the status quo. Octavian was ceded Gaul and Antony was reaffirmed as supreme commander in the entire east.

As luck would have it, Antony\xe2\x80\x99s wife Fulvia died shortly after, and Antony was free to remarry. Cementing their alliance, Antony married Octavian\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Octavia, and the two returned to Rome together and amidst a great deal of relief by the masses.

Octavian decided to return to Rome, and accepted the adoption and the three-fourths of Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s estate that was willed to him. He crossed over to Italy and recruited an army from among Caesar\'s veterans along the way. Octavian immediately dropped the "Octavianus" from his name, and referred to himself simply as Gaius Julius Caesar. In doing so doing, he immediately entrenched himself as a favorite both with the masses and the all important veteran legionaries.', "Despite this posturing, as war opened against Pompey, things did not initially go well. An attempted invasion of Sicily in 38 BC had to be aborted due to poor weather, and Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s successful intervention. By the following spring, 37 BC, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Consul and lifelong friend of Octavian, had gathered a massive fleet and trained it within an artificially enclosed harbor at Naples.  Though there were several engagements which set back the invasion, Agrippa turn the tide at the battle of Naulochus in September of 36 BC. Pompey fled to the east and never re-established a position of strength and was eventually destroyed by Antony in 35 BC. Lepidus meanwhile had Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s land forces under siege on Sicily. When news of the battle of Naulochus reached Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s men, they wished to surrender to Lepidus but Octavian refused it. Lepidus ignored this order, however and accepted the surrender, demanding control of Sicily as a result. Octavian replied with a brilliant stroke of political strategy. Arranging in advance to bribe Lepidus men to his own side, Octavian entered Lepidus\xe2\x80\x99 camp and essentially stripped him of all his political value. Taking Lepidus' nearly 18 legions under his own command, Lepidus was sent into partial exile in a small Italian town, where he lived out his remaining years as a relative non-player. Though he held the position of Pontifex Maximus, which he was given upon the death of Julius Caesar, he was virtually removed from all aspects of political life. At this point in 36 BC, the Triumvirate was officially over, leaving Octavian as the sole ruler of the west and Antony in the east, and though issues were settled for the time being, the monumental clash was inevitable.")],

[('To fit in the full length of the bass strings without making the piano too tall, these are sharply angled diagonally across the body of the piano. This also affects sound quality as the hammers do not strike parallel to the string, and causes problems in tuning due to the stresses on the frame at the transition point between string groups. Furthermore, the left-hand pedal\'s una corda function -- which on grand pianos moves the entire action, thereby making the hammers strike one string instead of three -- isn\'t possible, because the differences in string angle would not allow a consistent reduction in tone quality across the range of notes. The workaround, moving the hammers\' resting position closer to the strings, is reasonably effective in reducing volume, but the tone obtained is weak rather than expressive. Grand pianos have the frame and strings placed horizontally, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. This avoids the problems inherent in an upright piano, but takes up a great deal more space. Several sizes of grand piano exist. Manufacturers may vary, but in general they are: "concert grand": approx. 3m; "grand": approx 1.8m; and "baby grand".

[('Amanda Leigh "Mandy" Moore (born April 10, 1984) is an American pop music singer and actress. She was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, but grew up in Seminole County, Florida, outside Orlando. In between releasing albums, she attended Lake Brantley High School in Altamonte Springs.', "Later in 2003, Moore appeared on Punk'd, after being tricked by Ashton Kutcher for destroying someone else's home."), ('After the endeavors of her first two albums, Moore confessed that the music style and dance routines that had so heavily affected her success were \'not hers\', and that she no longer felt comfortable performing them. So, in an attempt to become more artistically \'in control\' of her music and image, Moore released the self-titled Mandy Moore on June 19, 2001. Critics hailed the album as an "attempt to stake her own space", and remarked that it was one of the most real and fulfilling pop albums on the market at the time. However, this critical success unfortunately did not lead to commercial success, as the LP debuted at a disappointing #35 on the Billboard 200. It has since went on to be certified gold in the US. The lead single, "In My Pocket", was tinged with a unique Middle-Eastern sound, along with a stunning, colorful video; It failed to make a dent in the charts, however, missing the Billboard Hot 100 completely. The follow-up single, "Crush", suffered the same fate, although it received considerable airtime on MTV. The final single, "Cry", was released in early 2002 and tied-in with Moore\'s movie A Walk to Remember. It also failed to perform well on the charts. The album sold well in Eastern Asia, however, and the songs "17" and "Saturate Me" were both released as singles overseas.', 'On December 7, 1999, fifteen-year old Moore released her debut album So Real on Sony\'s Epic Records, reaching a peak of #31 on the US Billboard 200 album chart. At the time when she burst out onto the music scene, Moore was considered only as the latest installment in a quickly-growing line of heavily-marketed \'Pop princesses\' that included Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson. As the last (and youngest) of the four to reach mainstream radio, her success didn\'t quite match that of her peers. Still, So Real managed to be certified platinum in the US by early 2000, while her debut single, the gold-selling "Candy" just missed the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at #41. A follow-up single entitled "Walk Me Home" was later released, though it failed to achieve much success. Moore released a re-worked version of her debut album entitled I Wanna Be With You on May 9, 2000, only six months after So Real hit stores. The album included several new songs, along with tracks from So Real, as well as a couple of remixed songs. I Wanna Be With You reached a peak of #21 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified gold in the US for selling over 500,000 copies. The title track was featured as the lead single, reaching a peak of #24 on the Hot 100 and becoming Moore\'s biggest hit to date. The song was also featured in the movie Center Stage.')],

[('In Islam Noah ("N&#363;&#7717;") is considered one of the Nabi (known as Navi in Hebrew) and Rasul of Islam. He is mentioned many times in the Qur\'an; chapter 71 of the Quran is called Nuh (Noah). According to the Quran, Noah was sent to his people who were musyrikin to guide them to worship God alone and warn them that they might lead to a destructive path if they didn\'t. Most of his people didn\'t believe him and rejected him so Noah started building the ark under the inspiration of God. When it was time for the flood, Noah took the believers and a pair of each kind with him and all the unbelievers drowned, including one of his sons (whom God later on told Noah that he wasn\'t part of Noah\'s family. Some people theorize that he might be a child between his wife and someone else, which might explain on why the Quran said that Noah\'s wife was punished for her fault toward Noah).', "Biblical fundamentalists assert that the story of Noah is a true story, and some claim that there is evidence for Noah's ark at what they describe as the Biblical Mount Ararat. Some have also claimed that the biblical story of the descent of mankind from Noah's sons is also literally true: see sons of Noah for a discussion of this idea."), ("The story of Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the later Abrahamic traditions, and was imensely influential in Western culture.  The story of Noah is mainly told in chapters 5-9 of the book of Genesis. Noah (repose or rest) was the son of Lamech. Amidst the general corruption of mankind, he found favor in the eyes of the Lord and received a divine command to build an ark for the saving of his house from the general deluge which the Lord was about to bring upon the earth (see also Ark and Deluge). After having left the ark, Noah offered as a burnt-sacrifice to the Lord one of all the pure animals that had been preserved. His sacrifice was accepted, and the Lord promised to bring no more a deluge over the earth; of which promise the sign he gave to Noah was the rainbow. Noah, being a husbandmen, cultivated the vine and having unwarily intoxicated himself by drinking of wine, he fell asleep in his tent. Ham, the father of Canaan, discovering him in this condition, made sport of him, and jeered with his two brothers; who going backwards, covered their father's nakedness by throwing a mantle over him. Noah awaking, and knowing what Ham had done, foretold the doom and slavery to Canaan and his posterity, while he blessed his other sons. Noah lived after the deluge 350 years, his whole life being 950 years. He had three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth among whom, according to the common opinion, he divided the whole world, giving to Shem Asia, to Ham Africa, and to Japheth Europe.", 'The Qu\'ran states that Noah was being inspired by the Spirit of God, like other prophets as Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, Solomon, David and he was a faithful messenger (26:107)(4:163) He continuously and plainly warned the people for for the painful doom that was coming, because they were wrong-doers and did not obey God (11:25)(29:14)(71:1-5). He called the people to serve God and said that they no other God could save them (23:23)He said that the deluge could not be stopped and that his people had to return to God, so that he could forgive them and give respite, because the time of the deluge was appointed and could not be delayed (7:59-64). But the chieftains, who disbelieved, said that he surely was in plain error and that Noah was just a mortal as they were. He replied to this accusation that there was no error in him, but that he was a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds and that he conveyed unto them the messages of God. Noah was sent as a reminder, to give the people a change to repent and to forgiven and find mercy (7:59-64)(26:105-110) God commanded him to build a ship by His inspiration. As he was building the ship, the chieftains passed him and they made mock of him. With completion, the ship was loaded with animals and his household (11:27-40). The people who denied the message of Noah were drowned (7:64). Noah is called a grateful servant (17:3) and among the seed of Noah (and Abraham) is placed the prophethood and the scripture (57:26)The Apocryphon of John reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made, but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon\'s plans, and Noah informed the remainder of humanity. Unlike the account of Genesis, not only are Noah\'s family saved, but many others also heed Noah\'s call. There is no ark in this account; instead Noah and the others hide in a "luminous cloud".')],

[('After its unsuccessful attack on the Allied centre, the French Imperial Guard rallied to their reserves of three battalions, (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte for a last stand against the British. A charge from General Adam\'s Brigade and an element of the 5th Brigade (The Hanoverian Landwehr (Militia) Osnabruck Battalion), both in the second Anglo-allied division under Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, threw them into a state of confusion; those which were left in semi-coherent units fought and retreated towards La Belle Alliance. It was during this stand that Colonel Hugh Halkett took the surrender of General Cambronne. This happened during the destruction of one of the retreating semi-coherent squares from the area around La Haye Sainte towards La Belle Alliance. The retort to a request to surrender may have been"La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!" "The Guard dies, it does not surrender!" or the response may have been the more earthy "Merde!", but Letters published in The Times in June 1932 record that Cambronne said neither, as he was already a prisoner, but that they may have been said by General Michel who was killed at Waterloo. [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/miscellaneous/c_cambronne.html The Guard dies, it does not surrender. Cambronne surrenders, he does not die].  At about same time as the Imperial Guard was thrown back, the Prussians finally drove the French out of the village of Plancenoit and Zieten\'s Corps entered the gap between d\'Erlon and Lobau, essentially taking the French position from the rear. The whole of the French front started to disintegrate under the general advance of the Anglo-allied army and the Prussians following the capture of Plancenoit. The last coherent French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around the inn called La Belle Alliance. This was a final reserve and a personal bodyguard for Napoleon. For a time Napoleon hoped that if they held firm the French Army could rally behind them. But as the retreat turned into a rout, they were forced to form squares as protection against the leading elements of allied cavalry. They formed into two squares, one on either side of La Belle Alliance. Until he was persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square which was formed on rising ground to the (Allied) right of the inn. The Prussians engaged the square to the left, and General Adam\'s Brigade charged the square on the right, forcing it to withdraw. As dusk fell both squares retreated away from the battlefield towards France in relatively good order but the French artillery, and everything else belonging to them, fell into the hands of the British and Prussians. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing Frenchmen who were no longer part of any coherent unit. British and Allied cavalry harried the fleeing French until about 23:00 hours. The Prussians, led by General von Gneisenau, pursued them throughout the night.', 'With Wellington\'s centre exposed by the French taking La Haye Sainte, and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard. This attack is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, but it is unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard. Marching through a hail of canister and skirmisher fire, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen defeated the Allied first line, including British, Brunswick and Nassau troops. Meanwhile, elements of General von Ziethen\'s 1st Prussian Army Corps had finally arrived helping to relieve the pressure on Wellington\'s left flank, thus allowing Wellington to strengthen his shaken centre. The French guard battalions marched on, and the situation became critical. Chass\xc3\xa9\'s Netherlands division was sent forward. Chass\xc3\xa9 sent forward his artillery to halt the French advance. Their fire took the victorious grenadiers in the flank. This still couldn\'t stop the Guard\'s advance, so Chass\xc3\xa9 ordered his first brigade to charge the French. Meanwhile, to the west, 1,500 British Guards under Maitland were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. They rose as one, and devastated the shocked Imperial Guard with volleys of fire at point-blank range. The French chasseurs deployed to answer the fire. After 10 minutes of exchanging musketry the outnumbered French began wavering. This was the sign for a bayonet charge. But then a fresh French chasseur battalion appeared on the scene. The British guard retired with the French in pursuit, but the French in their turn were halted by flanking fire from the 52nd Light Infantry of Adam\'s brigade. The last of the Imperial Guard retreated headlong in disarray and chaos. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines - "La garde recule. Sauve qui peut!" ("The Guard retreats. Save yourself if you can!"). Wellington, judging that the retreat by the Imperial Guard had unnerved all the French soldiers who saw it, stood up in the stirrups of Copenhagen (his favourite horse), and waved his hat in the air, signalling a general advance. The long-suffering Anglo-Allied infantry rushed forward from the lines where they had been shelled all day, and threw themselves upon the retreating French.'), ('The battle was to involve 73,000 French soldiers; while the Allied army from Britian, Hanover, Brunswick, and the Netherlands and Nassau, and the elemnts of the Prussian army engaged in the battle totalled approximately 82,000.', "See Order of Battle at WaterlooAt Waterloo, Wellington had the reinforced farm Hougomont anchoring his right flank, and several other farms on his left. Napoleon faced his first major problem even before the battle began. Unsure of the Prussian Army's position since its flight from Ligny two days previously, Napoleon was all too aware of the need to begin the assault on Wellington's positions. The battle commenced at about 10:00 with an attack upon Hougoumont, but the main attack, with the most feared weapon of the era, the French field artillery, was delayed for hours until the sodden ground from the previous nights's downpour had dried out sufficiently to take the weight of the French ordnance.  The mud also hindered infantry and cavalry as they trudged into position.  When the French artillery eventually opened fire on Wellington's ridge at around 11:35, the expected impact on the Allied troops was diminished by the soft terrain that absorbed the impact of many of the hurtling cannon balls. In addition, Wellington had characteristically placed the majority of the Allied army behind the ridgeline so as to shield the army from the expected barrage.")],

The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially "the same", due to closely related harmonics.  Notes in an octave will "ring" together giving it a very pleasing sound to music.  For this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\xe2\x80\x94the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called octave equivalency, the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are  musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention "that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave".Burns, Edward M. (1999). "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning", The Psychology of Music second edition, , p.252. Deutsch, Diana, ed. San Diego: Academic Press. ISBN 0-12-213564-4. This is similar to enharmonic equivalency, and less so transpositional equivalency and, less still, inversional equivalency, the latter of which is generally used only in counterpoint, musical set theory, or atonal theory.
