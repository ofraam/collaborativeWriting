VItaly (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe.\u000aIt is a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  The capital is Rome (Roma), but the economic capital is Milan (Milano) in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples (Napoli), Turin (Torino), Palermo, Genoa (Genova), Bologna,  Florence (Firenze), Venice (Venezia).  It is one of the countries that uses the Euro currency.\u000a National Flag  image:italiabandiera3.gif \u000aItaly is  well-known for its art, culture, and several monuments, among which the leaning tower of Pisa, as well as for its food (pizza, pasta, etc.), wine, lifestyle, elegance, design and friendliness.\u000aIts history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the whole Mediterranean area.\u000aRenaissance is indeed the best relevant art influence over the entire art history and Baroque has in Rome its most important shows.\u000aToday Italy is the principal reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, litterature, poetry, visual arts, holidays, and generally speaking, for taste.\u000aItaly became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under King Victor Emmanuel II (Vittorio Emanuele II), of the Savoy dinasty. The dinasty came from Savoia, a duchy between France and Piedmont (Piemonte - main town: Turin = Torino). They previously were also Kings of Sardinia (Sardegna, Sardinna), Italy's most beautiful island.\u000aRome itself, still held by Vatican State (Holy See), became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870 (Sep. 20th). \u000aThe Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. \u000aHowever, Fascism represented a unique case of social-ethic government which was able to build an organised State over the ruins of 19th century's weak governments, and to inspire the first national feeling of Italy.\u000aRevival popularly followed. \u000aItaly was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. \u000aPersistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.\u000aItaly has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. \u000aMost raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. \u000aItaly has been suggested to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.\u000aFootball is main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world's best football teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).\u000aBeautiful women: \u000aSofia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, Silvana Pampanini, Silvana Mangano, Virna Lisi, Ornella Muti, Claudia Cardinale. \u000aBeautiful men: \u000aMarcello Mastroianni, Vittorio De Sica, Vittorio Gassmann, Rodolfo Valentino, Rossano Brazzi, Raoul Bova.\u000aTailors: \u000a* Valentino (Valentino Garavani), who gave his name to a very special red color ("rosso Valentino")\u000a* Giorgio Armani\u000a* Gianfranco Ferré\u000a* Gianni Versace, now his sister Donatella\u000a* Nazareno Gabrielli\u000a* Krizia\u000a* Moschino\u000a* Dolce & Gabbana\u000a* Salvatore Ferragamo\u000a* Laura Biagiotti\u000aFashion firms: Gucci, Fendi, Bulgari, Benetton, Stefanel, Superga, Fila, Davide Cenci\u000aFamous firms:\u000a* Ferrari (cars)\u000a* Maserati (cars)\u000a* Lamborghini (cars)\u000a* Fiat (cars)\u000a* Lancia (cars)\u000a* Alfa Romeo (cars)\u000a* Pininfarina (cars)\u000a* Piaggio (motorbikes)\u000a* Gilera (motorbikes)\u000a* Moto Guzzi (motorbikes)\u000a* Aprilia (motorbikes)\u000a* Laverda (motorbikes)\u000a* Benelli (motorbikes and guns)\u000a* Ducati (motorbikes)\u000a* Beretta (guns)\u000a* Franchi (guns and bycicles)\u000a* Jacuzzi (furniture)\u000a* Bialetti (coffee machines)\u000a* Faema (coffee machines)\u000a* Gaggia (coffee machines)\u000a* Carpigiani (ice cream machines)\u000aFrom the CIA World Factbook 2000 and the U.S. Department of State website.

The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. However, Fascism represented a unique case of social-ethic government which was able to build an organised State over the ruins of 19th century's weak governments, and to inspire the first national feeling of Italy."

This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been suggested to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been suggested to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'
