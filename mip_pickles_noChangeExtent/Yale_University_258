V\u000aThis article is about the institution of higher learning in the United States. For other uses, see Yale (disambiguation).\u000aYale University is a private university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest American institution of higher education and one of the most prestigious and well-known in the world. The University has graduated numerous Nobel Prize laureates and U.S. Presidents, including William Clinton and George W. Bush. Its $12.7 billion academic endowment is the second largest worldwide (behind only its larger rival, Harvard University).\u000aYale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and Harvard is long and storied, by far the oldest in the Ivy League; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic competition is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge.\u000aYale's emphasis on undergraduate teaching is unusual among its peer research universities, and its undergraduates live in a unique residential college system. Yale College has produced more Rhodes Scholars than any undergraduate institution save Harvard. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States. The University has over 3,000 faculty members, with Sterling Professors considered the highest rank.\u000aYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  \u000aThe college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over £560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.\u000aYale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard Divinity School had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.\u000aYale's library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  \u000aYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.\u000aThe Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.  The Yale Dramatic Association, or "Dramat," is the second oldest college theater company in the country and has been putting up theatrical productions since its founding in 1900; the Dramat has featured the work of such noted artists as Cole Porter, Thornton Wilder, and Sam Waterston.\u000a Rectors of Yale College   (birth-death)  (years as rector)\u000a 1  Rev.

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )\u000aAlthough most of the Yale buildings have a Gothic architecture similar to that of Cambridge or Oxford universities and appear ancient, in fact they were built in the 1930s, a fact which becomes apparent when the gargoyles on the roofs of the buildings are more closely examined; they portray such distinctly contemporary college denizens as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict such distinctly contemporary scenes as a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute, or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette.

Yale College has produced more Rhodes Scholars than any undergraduate institution save Harvard. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States. The University has over 3,000 faculty members, with Sterling Professors considered the highest rank.

VYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over £560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.

VYale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard Divinity School had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.

VYale's library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.

VThe Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.  The Yale Dramatic Association, or "Dramat," is the second oldest college theater company in the country and has been putting up theatrical productions since its founding in 1900; the Dramat has featured the work of such noted artists as Cole Porter, Thornton Wilder, and Sam Waterston.

Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict such distinctly contemporary scenes as a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute, or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, added to the appearance of great age of these buildings by [http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=3566 splashing the walls with acid], deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages.

S"Yale University, one of eight Ivy League universities, was founded in 1701 at a meeting in Branford, Connecticut, in what later become the United States, by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day. The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city's largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents."

S"Yale University, one of eight Ivy League universities, was founded as the Collegiate School of Connecticut on October 9, 1701 at a meeting in Branford, Connecticut, in what later become the United States, by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day. The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city's largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents."

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

U.S. News and World Report magazine usually ranks Yale within the top two or three universities in the United States (together with Harvard and Princeton). With over 11 billion dollars in endowment, Yale is also the second wealthiest university in the United States. Yale\'s main rival is Harvard; their relationship is similar to that between Oxford and Cambridge in many ways. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Presidents", having graduated the last three presidents (Bush Sr., Clinton, W. Bush). The 2004 presidential election will also be a Yale vs. Yale battle between George W. Bush and John F. Kerry. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Yale is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Presidents", having graduated the last three presidents (George Bush Sr., William J. Clinton, George W. Bush). Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is noted for its prolific production of U.S. presidents, including the last three presidents (Bush Sr., Clinton, W. Bush).'

S'Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK. Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale Coat of Arms"Light & Truth"Yale University is a glorious private research university in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1701, Yale is the third oldest American collegiate institution and is well accepted as one of the greatest creations in the history of mankind. With over US$11 billion in endowment, Yale has the second largest academic endowment of any university in the United States (after Harvard), and is surely superior to that cluster of weenies in Cambridge.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).'

S'Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Yale College has the lowest admission rate of any undergraduate institution. (before Harvard).  Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Yale College has the lowest admission rate of any undergraduate institution. (before Harvard).  Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )Yale has a system of twelve residential colleges, instituted in 1930. The system is loosely modelled after the system found in British universities. However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )Yale has a system of twelve residential colleges, instituted in 1930. The system is loosely modelled after the system found in British universities. However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894).

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894).

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )Yale has a system of twelve residential colleges, instituted in 1930. The system is loosely modelled after the system found in British universities. However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. In addition, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act much also as academic units to the degree at Oxbridge. Tutoring does occur in the Yale colleges much like the Oxbridge colleges.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. According to The Princeton Review, applicants to the college "also look and often prefer" Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and Swarthmore. Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

According to The Princeton Review, applicants to the college "also look and often prefer" Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and Swarthmore. Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College is among the most selective in the United States. In 2004, its 9.9% acceptance rate made it the choosiest college in the United States. According to The Princeton Review, applicants to the college "also look and often prefer" Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and Swarthmore. Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.'

However, students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. Though the colleges at Yale, like their counterparts at Oxford and Cambridge act as social units, the Yale colleges do not act as academic units to the same degree as at Oxbridge.

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale had bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Medical School (1810), Divinity School (1822), Law School (1843), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the School of Fine Arts (1869), and School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Admission is extremely competitive, and according to The Atlantic Monthly, it is the fourth most selective college in the United States (after MIT, Princeton, and Caltech).'

Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S"Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge in the UK (see Oxbridge rivalry). Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Yale's emphasis on undergraduate teaching is unusual among its peer research universities, and its undergraduates live in a unique residential college system. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States."

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I.

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been an important forum for opinion and controversy since 1878.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and has helped to launch the careers of future politicians such as John Kerry.  Dwight Hall is the only campus-based community service umbrella organization whose entire range of social programs is run by students.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and frequently perform at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was founded by Cotton Mather and originally was known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods, 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a founder of the univeristy, contacted Elihu Yale for help.  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over 560 pounds, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes. The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a founder of the univeristy, contacted Elihu Yale for help.  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over 560 pounds, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes. The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S"Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Yale's emphasis on undergraduate teaching is unusual among its peer research universities, and its undergraduates live in a unique residential college system. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States."

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes. The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S"Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard) (haha again).  Yale's emphasis on undergraduate teaching is unusual among its peer research universities, and its undergraduates live in a unique residential college system. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States."

Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices.'

S"Yale is one of the eight members of the Ivy League. The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their historic rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country (after Harvard).  Yale's emphasis on undergraduate teaching is unusual among its peer research universities, and its undergraduates live in a unique residential college system. Yale's graduate schools include strong drama and arts programs and the most selective law school in the United States."

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10% of its applicants, is the most selective college in the United States, according to U.S. News and World Report, in which Yale consistently ranks as 3rd. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10% of its applicants, is the most selective college in the United States, according to U.S. News and World Report, in which Yale consistently ranks as 3rd. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been an important forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than sixty community service initiatives in New Haven.

The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10% of its applicants, is the most selective college in the United States. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports thirty-five varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential Colleges of Yale University ([http://www.yale.edu/admit/freshmen/residential_life/index.html official list]):#[http://www.yale.edu/berkeley/ Berkeley College] - named for the Rt. Rev. George Berkeley (though pronounced BERK-lee) (1685-1753)#[http://www.yale.edu/branford/ Branford College] - named for Branford, Connecticut#[http://www.yale.edu/calhoun/ Calhoun College] - named for John C.

Ezra Stiles and generally called simply "Stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. Its buildings were designed by Eero Saarinen.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F.

The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )Yale has a system of 12 residential colleges, instituted in the early 1930s through a grant by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbot.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, and Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Divinity_School had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale College, which accepts fewer than 10 percent of its applicants, is one of the most selective colleges in the United States, behind only MIT, Princeton, and Caltech according to The Atlantic Monthly. Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard Divinity School had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I.

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

Yale is also noted for its law school, medical school, graduate school, and school of music. The Yale Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard Divinity School had become too liberal.  The Yale Law School is the most selective in the United States, and has graduated U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.  The Yale Dramatic Association, or "Dramat," the second oldest college theater company in the country, has been putting up theatrical productions since its founding in 1900, and has featured the work of such artists as Cole Porter.'

Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'The Yale Daily News, the oldest daily college newspaper in the United States, has been a forum for opinion and controversy since 1878, and counts among its former chairmen Joseph Lieberman, William F. Buckley, Jr., and Strobe Talbott.  The Yale Political Union is the oldest student political organization in the United States, and is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry, Gerald Ford, and George Pataki.  Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 60 community service initiatives in New Haven.  The Whiffenpoofs began the tradition of college a capella singing groups in 1909, and often perform on television and at the White House.  The Yale Dramatic Association, or "Dramat," is the second oldest college theater company in the country and has been putting up theatrical productions since its founding in 1900; the Dramat has featured the work of such noted artists as Cole Porter, Thornton Wilder, and Sam Waterston.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), and Yale School of Music (1894). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'After complaints arose during the renovation in the late 1980s of early residential colleges, a swing dormitory was built in 1998 to facilitate housing students during the massive overhaul of buildings that had seen only intermediate improvements in plumbing, heating, electrical and network wiring, and general maintenance over their 30-to-60-year existence. The earliest buildings were [http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=3566 splashed with acid] to make their fresh rock facings appear more like the English schools they mimicked. The [http://yale.edu/yaleconf/facilities/housing.html?y New Residence Hall] is the unofficial 13th residential college; its future is only vaguely plotted out by the university.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'

Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'After complaints arose during the renovation in the late 1980s of early residential colleges, a swing dormitory was built in 1998 to facilitate housing students during the massive overhaul of buildings that had seen only intermediate improvements in plumbing, heating, electrical and network wiring, and general maintenance over their 30-to-60-year existence. The earliest buildings were [http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=3566 splashed with acid] to make their fresh rock facings appear more like the English schools they mimicked. The [http://yale.edu/yaleconf/facilities/housing.html?y New Residence Hall] is the unofficial 13th residential college; its future is only vaguely plotted out by the university.'

Levin        (1947-    )   (1993-    )Although most of the Yale buildings are in the Gothic style similar to Cambridge or Oxford universities and appear ancient, in fact they were built in the 1930s, a fact which becomes apparent when the gargoyles on the roofs of the buildings are more closely examined; they portray such distinctly contemporary college denizens as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict such distinctly contemporary scenes as a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute, or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette.

In fact, the buildings do not merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, but are actually constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner.

S'Yale has a system of 12 residential colleges, instituted in the early 1930s through a grant by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness, who admired the college system at Oxford and Cambridge. Undergraduate students are accepted by the university as a whole, and assigned to residential colleges at random. (A special dispensation, though, is made for "legacy" students or students with siblings currently enrolled in Yale College; they may request to be placed in the same college or to be placed in a different college.) Each college has a carefully constructed support structure for students, including a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows.  Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, and rich facilities ranging from libraries to squash courts to darkrooms.  While each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas with luminaries from the outside world, Yale students also take part in academic and social programs across the university, and all of Yale\'s 2,000 courses are open to undergraduates from any college. Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni; they are deliberately not named for benefactors.'

S'Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known collectively as the Founders, who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school first opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson in Killingworth, Connecticut.  In 1716, the school moved to New Haven, Connecticut, where it remains to this day.  The college was originally known as the Collegiate School; it adopted the name Yale after Cotton Mather, a friend of the Collegiate School because of his feuds with Harvard, contacted Elihu Yale for help (at the behest of either Rector Andrew or Governor Saltonstall).  Yale bestowed a generous gift of nine bales of goods (which the school sold, netting over \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum of money at the time), 417 books, and a portrait of King George I. Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale Medical School (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), Yale School of Fine Arts (1869), Yale School of Music (1894), and Yale School of Public Health (1915). In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale\'s library system is the second largest in North America with a total of almost 11 million volumes, after Harvard (15 million volumes). The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi. Other resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Center for British Art.  Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and Yale is an NCAA Division I member.  American football was largely created at Yale by player and coach Walter Camp, who evolved the rules of the game away from rugby and soccer in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, which is one of the largest and most elaborate indoor athletic complexes in the world.  The school mascot is "Handsome Dan", the famous Yale bulldog.'
