V\u000aThe Italian Republic or Italy (Italian: Repubblica italiana or Italia) is a country in Southern Europe. It comprises a  boot-shaped peninsula and two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea, Sicily and Sardinia, and shares its northern alpine boundary with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. It is a founding member of what is now the European Union, and a member state of the United Nations, NATO and the G8 nations. San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves countries within Italian territory, while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland. \u000a{| border=1 align=right cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 width=300 style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"\u000a|+Repubblica italiana\u000a|+Italian Republic\u000a| align="center" colspan="2"|\u000a{| border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style="background:#f9f9f9; text-align:center;"\u000a| width="130px"| 125px|Flag of Italy || align=center width=130px| \u000a|-\u000a| width="130px"| (In Detail) || align=center width=130px| (In Detail)\u000a|}\u000a|-\u000a| align=center colspan=2 |\u000a|-\u000a| align=center colspan=2 style="background:#f9f9f9;" | Location of Italy\u000a|-\u000a|Official language || Italian1\u000a|-\u000a|Capital and largest city || Rome\u000a|-\u000a|President || Carlo Azeglio Ciampi\u000a|-\u000a|Prime minister || Silvio Berlusconi\u000a|-\u000a|Area &nbsp;- Total &nbsp;- % water\u000a|Ranked 71st 301,230 km²2.40%\u000a|-\u000a|Population &nbsp;- Total (2005) &nbsp;- Density\u000a|Ranked 23rd 58,462,375 197/km&sup2;\u000a|-\u000a|Unification\u000a|17 March 1861\u000a|-\u000a|GDP (2005)  &nbsp; - PPP   &nbsp; - Nominal  &nbsp; - GDP/capita(PPP)  &nbsp; - GDP/capita(nom.)\u000a| $1.694 trillion(8th)  $1.836 trillion(7th)  $29,414 (19th)  $31,874 (20th)\u000a|-\u000a|Currency || Euro (&euro;)2\u000a|-\u000a| Time zone &nbsp;- in summer\u000a| CET (UTC+1)CEST (UTC+2)\u000a|-\u000a| National anthem || Il Canto degli Italiani\u000a|-\u000a| Internet TLD || .it\u000a|-\u000a| Calling Code || +39\u000a|-\u000a|colspan="2"| 1 German is the second official language of Alto Adige\u005cSouth Tyrol autonomous province. There are other 11 linguistic minorities (for example, French is spoken in the Aosta Valley) that are recognized by the italian constitution and laws.\u000a2 Prior to 1999: Italian Lira.\u000a|}\u000aMain article: History of Italy\u000aItaly has shaped the cultural and social development of the entire Mediterranean area, deeply influencing European culture as well. Important cultures and civilizations have existed there since prehistoric times. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilization and especially the Roman Republic and Empire that dominated this part of the world for many centuries, Italy was central to the development of modern European civilization, European philosophy, science and art during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\u000aModern Italy became a nation-state belatedly, following centuries of existence as a collection of smaller kingdoms and city-states; on March 17, 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero, and Giuseppe Mazzini, a political visionary and leader of the radical democratic faction in the movement for Italian unificatication (Risorgimento). With the annexation of Venetia (1866) and Rome (September 20, 1870), the Italian unification was complete.\u000aAfter the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. \u000aItaly was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999.\u000aThe etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. \u000aSpeakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The modern Italian word for calf is "vitelli" very simmilar to Viteliu. The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. \u000aDuring the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.\u000aBy about the time of the emperor Augustus, all of what is now known as the Italian peninsula was included in Italia, which was the central unit of the Empire; for example, the upper Po valley, which had been known as Cisalpine Gaul,  was formally appended to Italia in 42&nbsp;B.C. From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.\u000aMain article: Politics of Italy\u000aThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet)  (Consiglio dei ministri), headed by the prime minister (Presidente del consiglio dei ministri). The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.\u000aThe houses of parliament are popularly and directly elected by a mixed majoritarian and proportional representation system. Under 1993 legislation, Italy has single-member districts for 75% of the seats in parliament; the remaining 25% of seats are allotted on a proportional basis.\u000aThe Chamber of Deputies has officially 630 members (de facto, 619 only after the 2001 elections). In addition to 315 senators, elected members, the Senate includes former presidents and several other persons (no more than 5) appointed for life by the President of the Republic according to special constitutional provisions. Both houses are elected for a maximum of 5 years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term. Legislative bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both.\u000aThe Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. A constitutional court, the Corte Costituzionale, passes on the constitutionality of laws, and is a post-World War II innovation.\u000aMain article: Regions of Italy\u000aItaly is subdivided into 20 regions (regioni, singular regione), of which five enjoy a special autonomous status, marked by an *:\u000a*Abruzzo\u000a*Basilicata\u000a*Calabria\u000a*Campania\u000a*Emilia-Romagna\u000a*Friuli-Venezia Giulia *\u000a*Latium (Lazio)\u000a*Liguria\u000a*Lombardy (Lombardia)\u000a*Marche\u000a*Molise\u000a*Piedmont (Piemonte)\u000a*Apulia (Puglia)\u000a*Sardinia (Sardegna) *\u000a*Sicily (Sicilia) *\u000a*Tuscany (Toscana)\u000a*Trentino-South Tyrol (Trentino-Alto Adige) *\u000a*Umbria\u000a*Aosta Valley (Valle d'Aosta)*\u000a*Veneto\u000aAll regions except Valle d'Aosta are further subdivided into two or more provinces.\u000aMain article: Geography of Italy\u000aItaly consists predominantly of a large peninsula with a distinctive boot shape that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, where together with its two main islands Sicily and Sardinia it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the Adriatic Sea to the north-east, the Ionian Sea to the south-east, the Tyrrhenian Sea to the south-west and finally the Ligurian Sea to the north-west.\u000aThe Apennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north.\u000aHere is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Apennines and Dolomites.\u000aOther well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.\u000aIts highest point is Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) at 4,810 m, but Italy is more typically associated with two famous volcanoes: the currently dormant Vesuvius near Naples and the very active Etna on Sicily.\u000aMain article: Economy of Italy\u000aItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed south. In comparison to its western European neighbours, it has a high number of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEes).\u000aMost raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Union and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates. Italy joined the Euro from its introduction in 1999.\u000aItaly's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions\u000a*List of Italian companies\u000aMain article: Demographics of Italy\u000aItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million.\u000aAccording to the 2005 Almanac, the population is 96.0% Italian (one of the most homogenous in Europe), 0.9% Arab-North African, 0.8% Italo-Albanian, and smaller numbers of Romanians, Ukrainians, and others. \u000aRoman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Bené Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years. There is also a Muslim  immigrant community. (See also: Islam in Italy).\u000aMain article: Culture of Italy\u000aItaly is well-known for its art and culture. It has many famous works of architecture, among them the leaning tower of Pisa, the Roman Colosseum, the Greek temple of Neptune of Paestum. It is renowned for its food (pizza, pasta, etc.), wine, lifestyle, elegance, automobiles, bicycles, visual art and design, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, taste.\u000aEurope's Renaissance period began in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries. Literary achievements, such as the poetry of Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, and Ariosto and the prose of Boccaccio, Machiavelli, and Castiglione exerted a tremendous and lasting influence on the subsequent development of Western culture, as did the painting, sculpture, and architecture contributed by giants such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Melozzo da Forlì and Michelangelo. Modern artists include the sculptor Tommaso Geraci.\u000aThe musical influence of Italian composers Palestrina, Monteverdi, Corelli and Vivaldi proved epochal; in the 19th century, Italian romantic opera flourished under composers Gioacchino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, and Giacomo Puccini.\u000aContemporary Italian artists, writers, filmmakers, architects, composers, and designers continue to contribute significantly to Western culture.\u000aFootball (Italian: calcio; American English: soccer) is the most popular sport; the Italy national football team has won the Football World Cup three times, in 1934, 1938 and 1982. Formula One and Cycling are also very popular. Rugby is important in the north-east of Italy.\u000a*List of Italians\u000a*Cinema of Italy\u000a*Music of Italy\u000a*Holidays in Italy\u000aMain article: Languages of Italy\u000aItaly has many dialects, seen by some separatist movements as different languages. Almost every region, or province or city, in fact, has its own dialect, which derives from the history of that region. Near Venice, for instance, many persons know Venetian; near Naples, Neapolitan, but they are only local variations of Italian, comprehensible to each other.\u000aSome counts put the number of living languages [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Italy spoken in Italy] at 33, but real different languages, officially recognized by Parliament in 1999 ([http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm Italian law no 482]) are 12:\u000a* German (official, together Italian, in the authonomous province of South Tyrol/Upper Adige),\u000a* French (official, together Italian, in the authonomous region of Aosta Valley),\u000a* Provencal and Occitan (spoken in small communities, expecially in Piedmont),\u000a* Furlan, Ladin and Slovenian (these three especially spoken in the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia),\u000a* Greek (spoken in villages of southern Italy and Sicily - cultural remnants of Magna Graecia),\u000a* Albanian and Croatian (spoken in small villages in central or southern Italy as the result of more recent migrations),\u000a* Catalan (spoken in some communities of Sardinia)\u000a* Sardinian (divided into four local dialects), but controversial, because not everyone, in scientific community, agree to consider it a different language.\u000aRoma language didn't receive any recognition.\u000a \u000aTwo regions (Aosta Valley and Friuli-Venezia Giulia) and one Province (South Tyrol/Upper Adige) acquired special autonomous status for protection of the recognised ethnic minorities.\u000a*Communications in Italy\u000a*Food: Spaghetti, Pizza, Pandoro, Panettone.\u000a*Foreign relations of Italy\u000a*Islam in Italy\u000a*Italian nationality law\u000a*Italian orders of merit\u000a*List of Italian universities\u000a*Military of Italy\u000a*Police of Italy\u000a*Stamps and postal history of Italy\u000a*Tourism in Italy\u000a*Transportation in Italy\u000a*[http://www.italia.gov.it/ Italia.gov.it Main governmental portal] (in Italian)\u000a*[http://www.italy-weather-and-maps.com/ Italy - maps and weather] - Maps and 6 day weather forecasts for all of Italy \u000a*[http://www.big-italy-map.co.uk Map of Italy] - Maps of Italy and its regions\u000a*[http://www.esteri.gov.it/eng/ Ministero degli Affari Esteri, Italian Foreign Office]\u000a*[http://www.parlamento.it/ Parlamento] - Official site of the Italian parliament (Senate in Italian only)\u000a*[http://www.quirinale.it/ Presidenza della Repubblica] - Official site of the Italian president (in Italian)\u000aast:Italia\u000azh-min-nan:Italia\u000aals:Italien\u000afur:Italie\u000ahaw:Ikalia\u000ands:Italien\u000ascn:Italia\u000afiu-vro:Itaalia

VThe etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The modern Italian word for calf is "vitelli" very simmilar to Viteliu. The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.

VBy about the time of the emperor Augustus, all of what is now known as the Italian peninsula was included in Italia, which was the central unit of the Empire; for example, the upper Po valley, which had been known as Cisalpine Gaul,  was formally appended to Italia in 42&nbsp;B.C. From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.

VMain article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet)  (Consiglio dei ministri), headed by the prime minister (Presidente del consiglio dei ministri). The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.

It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Bené Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years. There is also a Muslim  immigrant community.

S'Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the city-states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under King Victor EMMANUEL. The Fascist dictatorship of Benito MUSSOLINI that took over after World War I led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Italian defeat in World War II. Revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the euro in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy must work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

S'Modern Italy became a nation-state belatedly, following centuries of existence as a collection of smaller kingdoms and city-states; on March 17, 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero, and Giuseppe Mazzini, a political visionary and leader of the radical democratic faction in the movement for Italian unificatication (Risorgimento). With the annexation of Venetia (1866) and Rome (September 20, 1870), the Italian unification was complete.'

On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million."

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

This type of politics has been popularized in part by a separatist Northern Italian political party that views Southern Italians, particularly the Mezzogiorno region in Southern Italy, to be inferior to Northern Italians, and view Southern Italy as an economic burden on Northern Italy."

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"Italy has experienced a lot of controversy through out history. One of Italy's biggest controversies of today is the separatist organization, Northern League (Lega Nord). The goal of the Northern League is to have Padania (an area of Northern Italy) secede from Italy and become an independent country. This type of politics has been popularized in part by a separatist Northern Italian political party that views Southern Italians, particularly the Mezzogiorno region in Southern Italy, to be inferior to Northern Italians, and view Southern Italy as an economic burden on Northern Italy."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million."

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S'By about the time of the emperor Augustus, all of what is now known as the Italian peninsula was included in Italia, which was the central unit of the Empire; for example, the upper Po valley, which had been known as Cisalpine Gaul,  was formally appended to Italia in 42&nbsp;B.C. From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million."

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

From thence onwards, "Italia" gradually acquired its modern definition as the common name for the territory of the entire peninsula.'

The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S'The etymology of the word Italia comes from the Latin Italia, having entered early Latin either from the Greek language spoken in Southern Italy begining in the 8th century B.C. &mdash;the name Italia (Italy) was used by the Greek colonists in Sicily to refer to the people and territory of Southern Calabria&mdash; or from another source. There are competing explanations of the etymology of Italia. If not derived from the name of an ancient Calabrian tribe, then it probably relates to an ancient Greek word italos (bull), from Proto-Indo-European *wet; the Greek word follows the sound-changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Greek, but the Latin equivalent vitulus (young bull) from this root, does not. Speakers of ancient Oscan called Italy Viteliu, also from PIE *wet. Varro wrote that the region got its name from the excellence and abundance of its cattle (italos\', "bull" hence italia). Some disagree with this etymology as its origin is unclear, but could mean "Land of Cattle Calves or Veal". The name Viteliu is however documented and linked to the Italic tribes of southern and central Italy. During the first Social war (90 BCE), the Samnites and their allies (Sabines, Samnites, Umbrians and others) produced coinage while competing with Rome bearing the word "Vitelio." There is much debate as to the exact origin of the name Italia, and there are many theories concerning its etymology.'

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million."

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S'Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet)  (Consiglio dei ministri), headed by the prime minister (Presidente del consiglio dei ministri). The President of the Republic (Presidente della Repubblica) is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (Fiducia, trust) of both houses.'

It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre.

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years.

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."

S"Italy's economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196&nbsp;people per square kilometre. Almost 2&nbsp;million immigrants live legally in Italy, according to ISTAT, Italy's official statistics office; according to the report of Caritas for 2005, the figure is near 3&nbsp;million."

Roman Catholicism is the majority religion: 90% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic, although the figure is based on infant baptism and masks persons who have become agnostics and atheists by choice in later life. There are also communities who adhere to the Protestant Church, as well as the Ben\xc3\xa9 Roma who have been practicing Judaism in Italy for thousands of years. There is also a Muslim  immigrant community. (See also: Islam in Italy).'

Formula One and Cycling are also very popular. Rugby is important in the north-east of Italy.*List of Italians*Cinema of Italy*Music of Italy*Holidays in ItalyMain article: Languages of ItalyItaly has many dialects, seen by some separatist movements as different languages. Almost every region, or province or city, in fact, has its own dialect, which derives from the history of that region. Near Venice, for instance, many persons know Venetian; near Naples, Neapolitan, but they are only local variations of Italian, comprehensible to each other.'

S"After the victory during World War I, the Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 with the March on Rome, led, in 1936-37, to the alliance with Nazi Germany and other Axis Powers and ultimately, in September 1943, Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946, a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO (April 4, 1949) and the European Union (1952/58) and on December 14, 1955 Italy joined the United Nations. Italy had joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe as a signatory to the Treaty of Rome in 1956, and the adoption of Euro in 1999."
