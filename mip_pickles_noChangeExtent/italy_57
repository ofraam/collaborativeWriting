V \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Italian Republic or Italy is a country in the south of Europe, consisting mainly of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia. \u000aTo the north it is bound by the Alps, where it borders France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia. \u000aRepubblica Italiana\u000a(In Detail)\u000aNational motto: None\u000aOfficial language            Italian         (+ German and Ladin in South Tyrol, Slovenian in Friuli-Venezia Giulia and French in Valle d'Aosta.)         \u000aCapital                      Rome\u000aPresident                        Carlo Azeglio Ciampi\u000aPrime minister     Silvio Berlusconi\u000aArea&nbsp;- Total &nbsp;- % waterRanked 69th  301,230 km²  2.4%               \u000aPopulation \u000a&nbsp;- Total (2002) \u000a&nbsp;- Density                 Ranked 22nd\u000a 57'715'625  \u000a 196/km²\u000aIndependence\u000a&nbsp;- Date                   Italian unification\u000aMarch 17, 1861\u000aCurrency                     Euro&sup1; (EUR), Italian euro coins\u000aTime zone                    UTC +1\u000aNational anthem              Fratelli d'Italia\u000aInternet TLD.IT\u000aCalling Code39\u000a(1) Prior to 1999: Lira\u000aMain article: History of Italy\u000aItaly's history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. \u000aThe country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. \u000aAfter Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. \u000aThe city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  \u000aThe Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. The architect of Italian unification, however, was Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel.\u000aRome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification.  The Vatican is now an independent enclave surrounded by Italy, as is San Marino.\u000aThe Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and ultimately Italy's defeat in World War II. \u000aOn June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. \u000aMembers of the royal family were sent into exile because of their association with the fascist regime.\u000aItaly was a charter member of NATO and the European Union, and hence joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. \u000aMain article: Politics of Italy\u000aThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). \u000aThe president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. \u000aThe president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). \u000aThe Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.\u000aThe houses of parliament are popularly and directly elected by a mixed majoritarian and proportional representation system. \u000aUnder 1993 legislation, Italy has single-member districts for 75% of the seats in parliament; the remaining 25% of seats are allotted on a proportional basis. \u000aThe Chamber of Deputies has 630 members. \u000aIn addition to 315 elected members, the Senate includes former presidents and several other persons appointed for life according to special constitutional provisions. \u000aBoth houses are elected for a maximum of 5 years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term. Legislative bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both.\u000aThe Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. \u000aA constitutional court, the Corte Costituzionale, which passes on the constitutionality of laws, is a post-World War II innovation.\u000aMain article: Regions of Italy\u000aMap\u000aItaly is subdivided into 20 regions (regioni, singular regione), of which five enjoy a special autonomous status, marked by a *:\u000a*Abruzzo\u000a*Basilicata\u000a*Calabria\u000a*Campania\u000a*Emilia-Romagna\u000a*Friuli-Venezia Giulia *\u000a*Latium (Lazio)\u000a*Liguria\u000a*Lombardy (Lombardia)\u000a*Marche\u000a*Molise\u000a*Piedmont (Piemonte)\u000a*Apulia (Puglia)\u000a*Sardinia (Sardegna) *\u000a*Sicily (Sicilia) *\u000a*Tuscany (Toscana)\u000a*Trentino-South Tyrol(Trentino-Alto Adige) *\u000a*Umbria\u000a*Aosta Valley (Valle d'Aosta)*\u000a*Veneto\u000aA region can be further subdivided into provinces.\u000aMain article: Geography of Italy\u000aItaly consists predominantly of a large peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, where together with its two main islands Sicily and Sardinia it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the Adriatic Sea to the north-east, the Ionian Sea to the south-east, the Tyrrhenian Sea to the south-west and finally the Ligurian Sea to the north-west. \u000aThe Apennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. \u000aHere is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. \u000aOther well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.\u000aIts highest point is the Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) at 4,810 m, but Italy is more typically associated with two famous volcanoes: the currently dormant Vesuvius near Naples and the very active Etna on Sicily.\u000aMain article: Economy of Italy\u000aItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. \u000aThis capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. \u000aMost raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. \u000aOver the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. \u000aItaly's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. \u000aIt has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.\u000a*List of Italian companies\u000aMain article: Demographics of Italy\u000aItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. \u000aItaly has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. \u000aMinority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking in South Tyrol (1991: 287.503 german and 116.914 italian speaking) and the Slovenians around Trieste. \u000aOther minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; \u000athe Sardinian language on Sardinia); \u000athe Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; \u000aand the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages.\u000aIn addition there exist several small local minorities, \u000asuch as the Occitans in the southern Piedmont valleys; \u000athe Catalans in the town of Alghero on Sardinia; Albanians in villages in Calabria and Sicily; \u000aand ancient Greek dialects in villages of Calabria.\u000aAlthough Roman Catholicism is the majority religion (85% of native-born citizens are nominally Catholic) there are mature Protestant and Jewish communities and a growing Muslim immigrant community.\u000aMain article: Culture of Italy\u000aItaly is well-known for its art, culture, and several monuments, among them the leaning tower of Pisa and the Roman Colosseum, as well as for its food (pizza, pasta, etc.), wine, lifestyle, elegance, design, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste.\u000aEurope's Renaissance period began in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries. \u000aLiterary achievements, such as the poetry of Petrarch, Tasso, and Ariosto and the prose of Boccaccio, Machiavelli, and Castiglione exerted a tremendous and lasting influence on the subsequent development of Western culture, as did the painting, sculpture, and architecture contributed by giants such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raffaello, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and Michelangelo.\u000aThe musical influence of Italian composers Monteverdi, Palestrina, and Vivaldi proved epochal; in the 19th century, Italian romantic opera flourished under composers Gioacchino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi, and Giacomo Puccini. \u000aContemporary Italian artists, writers, filmmakers, architects, composers, and designers continue to contribute significantly to Western culture.\u000aFootball is the main national sport. \u000aItaly has won the Football World Cup three times: in 1934, 1938 and 1982. Italian football has produced some of world's best football players and teams. \u000aThe latter include A.C. Milan and Inter Milano FC from Milan, A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio from Rome, Juventus from Turin, and Fiorentina from Florence.\u000a*List of Italians\u000a*Cinema of Italy\u000a*Music of Italy\u000a  Holidays\u000a  \u000a    Date\u000a    English Name\u000a    Local Name\u000a    Remarks\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    January 1\u000a    New Year's Day\u000a    Capodanno\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    January 6\u000a    Epiphany\u000a    Epifania\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    Moveable\u000a    Easter Sunday\u000a    Pasqua\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    Moveable\u000a    Easter Monday\u000a    Lunedì di Pasqua\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    April 25\u000a    Anniversary of Liberation\u000a    Liberazione\u000a    1945\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    May 1\u000a    Labour day\u000a    Festa del Lavoro\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    June 2\u000a    Republic Day\u000a    Festa della Repubblica\u000a    1946\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    August 15\u000a    Assumption Day\u000a    Assunzione\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    November 1\u000a    All Saints\u000a    Tutti i Santi\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    December 8\u000a    Immaculate Conception\u000a    Immacolata\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    December 25\u000a    Christmas\u000a    Natale\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    December 26\u000a    St. Stephen's Day\u000a    Santo Stefano\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a  \u000a    December 31\u000a    New Year's Eve\u000a    San Silvestro\u000a    &nbsp;\u000a  \u000a*[http://www.rsf.fr/article.php3?id_article=4116 world-wide press freedom index] Rank 40 out of 139 countries \u000a*Communications in Italy\u000a*Transportation in Italy\u000a*Military of Italy \u000a*Foreign relations of Italy\u000a*Tourism in Italy\u000a*[http://www.quirinale.it/ Presidenza della Repubblica] - Official site of the Italian president (in Italian)\u000a*[http://www.parlamento.it/ Parlamento] - Official site of the Italian parliament (Senate in Italian only)\u000a*[http://www.gov.it/ gov.it Main governmental portal] (in Italian)\u000a*[http://www.esteri.it/eng/index.htm Farnesina, Italian Foreign Office]\u000a*[http://www.mi.cnr.it/WOI/woiindex.html Windows on Italy] - More information about Italy (in English)\u000a*[http://numismondo.com/pm/ita/   Italy Banknotes]\u000aEuropean Union:\u000aAustria &nbsp;|&nbsp; Belgium &nbsp;|&nbsp; Denmark &nbsp;|&nbsp; Finland &nbsp;|&nbsp; France &nbsp;|&nbsp; Germany &nbsp;|&nbsp; GreeceIreland &nbsp;|&nbsp; Italy &nbsp;|&nbsp; Luxembourg &nbsp;|&nbsp; Netherlands &nbsp;|&nbsp; Portugal &nbsp;|&nbsp; Spain &nbsp;|&nbsp; Sweden &nbsp;|&nbsp; United Kingdom\u000aCountries acceding to membership on May 1, 2004:\u000aCyprus &nbsp;|&nbsp; Czech Republic  &nbsp;|&nbsp; Estonia &nbsp;|&nbsp; Hungary &nbsp;|&nbsp; Latvia &nbsp;|&nbsp; Lithuania  &nbsp;|&nbsp; Malta &nbsp;|&nbsp; Poland &nbsp;|&nbsp; Slovakia &nbsp;|&nbsp; Slovenia\u000a----\u000aCountries of the world &nbsp;|&nbsp; Europe &nbsp;|&nbsp; Council of Europe

VThe Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and ultimately Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Members of the royal family were sent into exile because of their association with the fascist regime.

VItaly was a charter member of NATO and the European Union, and hence joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.

VThe houses of parliament are popularly and directly elected by a mixed majoritarian and proportional representation system. Under 1993 legislation, Italy has single-member districts for 75% of the seats in parliament; the remaining 25% of seats are allotted on a proportional basis. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 members. In addition to 315 elected members, the Senate includes former presidents and several other persons appointed for life according to special constitutional provisions. Both houses are elected for a maximum of 5 years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term. Legislative bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both.

VMain article: Geography of ItalyItaly consists predominantly of a large peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, where together with its two main islands Sicily and Sardinia it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the Adriatic Sea to the north-east, the Ionian Sea to the south-east, the Tyrrhenian Sea to the south-west and finally the Ligurian Sea to the north-west. The Apennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.

VMain article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking in South Tyrol (1991: 287.503 german and 116.914 italian speaking) and the Slovenians around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages.

Literary achievements, such as the poetry of Petrarch, Tasso, and Ariosto and the prose of Boccaccio, Machiavelli, and Castiglione exerted a tremendous and lasting influence on the subsequent development of Western culture, as did the painting, sculpture, and architecture contributed by giants such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raffaello, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, and Michelangelo.

This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been suggested to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been suggested to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. The Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. In 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of a republic. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.'

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata especially in the town of Matera. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilisation and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

S"Benito Mussolini (1886-1945) is the greatest modern leader of Italy, if you count him as great. Benny thought he was the greatest military leader of Italy since the mighty Trajan. As a conqueror of foreign lands, however, he came far short of Trajan's achievements. Mussolini's armies conquered the powerful nations of Ethiopia (1936) and Albania (1939) and he made King Victor Emmanuel II the emperor of Ethiopia and the king of Albania. However, Mussolini's great war machine stubbed its toes when he took on Greece in 1940. In fact, the Greeks were threatening to take over Albania when Benny's friend Adolf Hiter, Fuehrer of Krautland, came to his aid in 1941. Later that same year, his armies failed in an invasion of Egypt, where they were routed by the Limeys. Again, the Krauts came to their aid, with a great general named Erwin Rommel who had actually kicked a lot of Dago Wop ass in World War I."

S'Benny Mussolini was well-known for sleeping with as many women as he could and for ordering many famous military campaigns, including the one in the winter of 1940 in the mountains of Greece, and the heroic conquest of Albania. Apparently, he feared that Albania might someday invade Italy. Later on, his soldiers also participated in great conquest of the powerful nation of Yugoslavia. But at the end of the war, when he and his friend Dolph had been defeated, he was caught and strung up like a side of beef.'

Although it has been in a steady decline for more than 1500 years, at one time it may have been the greatest power the world had ever seen. Back in those days, we called it the Roman Empire. You can read about it by following the link. Suffice it to say that the country that gave us the likes of Benny Mussolini once gave us such men as Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Aurelian and Constantine the Great.

Things got so bad that when the Ostrogoths--that's right--Goths--came to Italy in 489, what was left of the Italians welcomed them with open arms. Oh, how the mighty had fallen...inviting the GOTHS to come take you over!"

Showing just how stupid the Wops had become, his own people rejected him, so he went to serve the Froggies. Of course, being leader of the Froggies rubbed off on him eventually, and he did a typical stupid Froggie move by attacking the Russkies in 1812, losing half a million men. His empire fell apart, and the Krauts took over much of Italy again.'

S"Italy (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe, consisting of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  The capital is Rome, but the economic capital is Milan in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Venice. The peninsula is extended among Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea. Italy is one of the countries that use the Euro currency; its national bank is Banca d'Italia, better known as Bankitalia."

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata especially in the town of Matera. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilisation and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. In 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of a republic. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime (mafia), corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

S"Italy (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe, consisting of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  The capital is Rome, but the economic capital is Milan in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Venice. The peninsula is extended among Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea. Italy is one of the countries that use the Euro currency; its national bank is Banca d'Italia, better known as Bankitalia."

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilization and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870, final date of the Italian unification. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S.

S"Italy (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe, consisting of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  The capital is Rome, but the economic capital is Milan in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Venice. The peninsula is extended among Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea. Italy is one of the countries that use the Euro currency; its national bank is Banca d'Italia, better known as Bankitalia."

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

S'The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Union and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.'

S'Main article: Geography of ItalyItaly consists predominantly of a large peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, where together with its two main islands Sicily and Sardinia it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the Adriatic Sea to the north-east, the Ionian Sea to the south-east, the Tyrrhenian Sea to the south-west and finally the Ligurian Sea to the north-west. The Appenines mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appenines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 191 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking people of Bolzano Province in Trentino-Alto Adige and the Slovenes around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages."

After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped shape the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  Italy became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification.

S'The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Union and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president).

S'The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Union and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.'

In addition to 315 elected members, the Senate includes former presidents and several other persons appointed for life according to special constitutional provisions. Both houses are elected for a maximum of 5 years, but either may be dissolved before the expiration of its normal term.

The Appennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

S"Main article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking people of Bolzano Province in Trentino-Alto Adige and the Slovenes around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages."

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification. The Vatican is now an independent enclave surrounded by Italy, as is San Marino."

S"The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and ultimately Italy's defeat in World War II. On June 2, 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of the Italian republic, which led to the adoption of a new constitution on January 1, 1948. Members of the royal family were sent into exile because of their association with the fascist regime."

This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically.

S'Main article: Geography of ItalyItaly consists predominantly of a large peninsula that extends into the Mediterranean Sea, where together with its two main islands Sicily and Sardinia it creates distinct bodies of water, such as the Adriatic Sea to the north-east, the Ionian Sea to the south-east, the Tyrrhenian Sea to the south-west and finally the Ligurian Sea to the north-west. The Appennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

S"Main article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically.

Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.'

Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth.

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification. The Vatican is now an independent enclave surrounded by Italy, as is San Marino."

The Appennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

S"Main article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking in South Tyrol (1991: 287.503 german and 116.914 italian speaking) and the Slovenes around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages."

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only on September 20, 1870, the final date of Italian unification. The Vatican is now an independent enclave surrounded by Italy, as is San Marino."

The Appennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. The architect of Italian unification, however, was Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel."

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. The architect of Italian unification, however, was Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel."

S'Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Union, and hence joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.'

The Appennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

S"Main article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.* List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking in South Tyrol (1991: 287.503 german and 116.914 italian speaking) and the Slovenians around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages."

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. The architect of Italian unification, however, was Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel."

S'Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Union, and hence joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Main article: Politics of ItalyThe 1948 constitution established a bicameral parliament (Parlamento), consisting of a Chamber of Deputies (Camera dei Deputati) and a Senate (Senato della Repubblica), a separate judiciary, and an executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (cabinet), headed by the president of the council (prime minister). The president of the republic is elected for 7 years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers (mostly, but not necessarily composed of members of parliament) must retain the confidence (Fiducia) of both houses.'

The Apennine mountains form the backbone of this peninsula, leading north-west to where they join the Alps, the mountain range that then forms an arc enclosing Italy from the north. Here is also found a large alluvial plain, the Po-Venetian plain, drained by the Po River and its many tributaries flowing down from the Alps, Appennines and Dolomites. Other well-known rivers include the Tiber, Adige and Arno.'

S"Main article: Economy of ItalyItaly has a diversified industrial economy with roughly the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the Economic and Monetary Unions and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates and joined the Euro from its conception in 1999. Italy's economic performance has lagged behind that of its EU partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing needed structural reforms, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy's rigid labour market and expensive pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from labour unions.*List of Italian companiesMain article: Demographics of ItalyItaly is largely homogeneous linguistically and religiously but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. Italy has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 196 persons per square kilometre. Minority groups are small, the largest being the German speaking in South Tyrol (1991: 287.503 german and 116.914 italian speaking) and the Slovenians around Trieste. Other minority groups with partly official languages include the French speaking minority in the Valle d'Aosta region; the Sardinian language on Sardinia); the Ladin language in the Dolomites mountains; and the Friulian language in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, all four being Romance languages."

The country has been host to important human activities in prehistoric times, and thusly archaeological sites of note can be found in many regions: Latium and Tuscany, Umbria and Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, the Etruscan civilisation and especially the Roman Empire that came to dominate this part of the world for many centuries, came the medieval Humanism and the Renaissance that further helped to shape European philosophy and art. The city of Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque.  The Italy of modern time became a nation-state belatedly - on March 17, 1861 when the states of the peninsula and the Two Sicilies were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. The architect of Italian unification, however, was Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel."
