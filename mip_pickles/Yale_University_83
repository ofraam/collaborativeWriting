V\u000aYale University is a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut.  Founded in 1701, Yale is the third oldest American collegiate institution and is well accepted as one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  Yale is well known for everything from its research in developing the latest AIDS cocktail drugs to having bestowed degrees on the past three U.S. presidents.  With over 11 billion dollars in endowment, Yale has the second largest academic endowment of any university in the United States.\u000aYale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Presidents", having graduated the last three presidents (George Bush Sr., William J. Clinton, George W. Bush). \u000aHarkness Tower\u000aYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  \u000aThe college's original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.\u000aIn addition to a respected undergraduate college, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, and school of music. The Divinity School was founded in the early 19th century by Congregationalists who felt that the Harvard University divinity school had become too liberal.\u000aYale's library system is among the largest in North America. The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes. The Beinecke Rare Book Library is housed in a marble building designed by Gordon Bunshaft, of the firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. Its courtyard sculptures are by Isamu Noguchi.\u000aOther resources include the Peabody Museum of Natural History and a museum of British art.\u000aYale's sports teams are called the Bulldogs.  They participate in the NCAA's Division I (I-AA in football).\u000a \u000a Rectors of Yale College   (birth-death)  (years as rector)\u000a 1  Rev.

S"Yale University, one of eight Ivy League universities, was founded as the Collegiate School of Connecticut on October 9, 1701 at a meeting in Branford, Connecticut, in what later become the United States, by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school's first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day. The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city's largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents."

S'Yale University is considered to be one of the world\'s most prestigious universities.  Yale is one of eight Ivy League universities, traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  As of 2003, Yale has the second largest endowment of any private university in the world.  The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city\'s largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents.'

The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale University is a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut and is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  Founded in 1701, Yale is the third oldest American collegiate institution and is well accepted as one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  U.S. News and World Report magazine usually ranks Yale within the top two or three universities in the United States (together with Harvard and Princeton). With over 11 billion dollars in endowment, Yale is also the second wealthiest university in the United States. Yale\'s main rival is Harvard; their relationship is similar to that between Oxford and Cambridge in many ways. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S"Yale University is a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut and is one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  Founded in 1701, Yale is the third oldest American collegiate institution and is well accepted as one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  U.S. News and World Report magazine usually ranks Yale within the top two or three universities in the United States (together with Harvard and Princeton). With over 11 billion dollars in endowment, Yale is also the second wealthiest university in the United States. Yale's main rival is Harvard; their relationship is similar to that between Oxford and Cambridge in many ways. Yale also ranks number two in terms of the number of Rhodes Scholars it has graduated."

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Presidents", having graduated the last three presidents (Bush Sr., Clinton, W. Bush). The 2004 presidential election will also be a Yale vs. Yale battle between George W. Bush and John F. Kerry. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Yale is sometimes referred to as the "Cradle of Presidents", having graduated the last three presidents (Bush Sr., Clinton, W. Bush). The 2004 presidential election will also be a Yale vs. Yale battle between George W. Bush and John F. Kerry. In the 2004 democratic primaries, Joe Lieberman and Howard Dean were also Yale graduates.'

S'Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'

S'Yale is the second most prolific university in terms of Rhodes Scholar graduates in the country.  Yale is also one of the eight members of the Ivy League.  The rivalry between Yale and fellow Ivy League school Harvard is long and storied; from academics to rowing to college football, their rivalry is similar to that of Oxford and Cambridge. Harkness TowerYale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School" passed by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut and dated October 9, 1701, which was furthered by a meeting in Branford, Connecticut by a group of ten Congregationalist ministers who pooled their books to form the school\'s first library.  The school itself opened in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, but moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716, where it remains to this day.  The college\'s original name was the Collegiate School; it was renamed Yale after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale. In the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.'
