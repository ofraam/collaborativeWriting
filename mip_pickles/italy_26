V\u000aItaly (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe, consisting of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  \u000aThe capital is Rome, but the economic capital is Milan in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Venice. The peninsula is extended among Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea. Italy is one of the countries that use the Euro currency; its national bank is Banca d'Italia, better known as Bankitalia.\u000a National Flag  image:Italiabandiera3.gif \u000aItaly is  well-known for its art, culture, and several monuments, among them the leaning tower of Pisa and the Roman Colosseum, as well as for its food (pizza, pasta, etc.), wine, lifestyle, elegance, design and friendliness.\u000aIts history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilization and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. \u000aItaly became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870, final date of the Italian unification. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.\u000aThe Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. In 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of a republic. \u000aItaly was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. \u000aPersistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime (mafia), corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.\u000aItaly has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. \u000aMost raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy's inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. \u000aItaly has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. \u000aFootball is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world's best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S.

S'Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the city-states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under King Victor EMMANUEL. The Fascist dictatorship of Benito MUSSOLINI that took over after World War I led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Italian defeat in World War II. Revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the euro in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime, corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy must work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with more than 20% unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy must work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Growth was 1.3% in 1999 and should edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports.'

The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. However, Fascism represented a unique case of social-ethic government which was able to build an organised State over the ruins of 19th century's weak governments, and to inspire the first national feeling of Italy."

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilisation and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S.

Although most natives of Italy find these names offensive, any country that lionizes Benito Mussolini as a great leader for as long as they did, can be said to deserve it.'

They used to have a king, before they got their asses kicked in World War II, but after the war, they voted him off the throne. Even though his family are still citizens of Guinea Whoppaly, they keep them from coming into the country.'

S"Benito Mussolini (1886-1945) is the greatest modern leader of Italy, if you count him as great. Benny thought he was the greatest military leader of Italy since the mighty Trajan. As a conqueror of foreign lands, however, he came far short of Trajan's achievements. Mussolini's armies conquered the powerful nations of Ethiopia (1936) and Albania (1939) and he made King Victor Emmanuel II the emperor of Ethiopia and the king of Albania. However, Mussolini's great war machine stubbed its toes when he took on Greece in 1940. In fact, the Greeks were threatening to take over Albania when Benny's friend Adolf Hiter, Fuehrer of Krautland, came to his aid in 1941. Later that same year, his armies failed in an invasion of Egypt, where they were routed by the Limeys. Again, the Krauts came to their aid, with a great general named Erwin Rommel who had actually kicked a lot of Dago Wop ass in World War I."

S'Benny Mussolini was well-known for sleeping with as many women as he could and for ordering many famous military campaigns, including the one in the winter of 1940 in the mountains of Greece, and the heroic conquest of Albania. Apparently, he feared that Albania might someday invade Italy. Later on, his soldiers also participated in great conquest of the powerful nation of Yugoslavia. But at the end of the war, when he and his friend Dolph had been defeated, he was caught and strung up like a side of beef.'

It also makes junky cars, like France does. Fiat is one of the biggest producers of junk automobiles of all time, even more so than Renault. On the other hand, it also has great engineers, who build good cars like the Ferrari and Alfa Romeo.'

S"Italy wasn't always such a weak, degenerate nation, though. Although it has been in a steady decline for more than 1500 years, at one time it may have been the greatest power the world had ever seen. Back in those days, we called it the Roman Empire. You can read about it by following the link. Suffice it to say that the country that gave us the likes of Benny Mussolini once gave us such men as Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Aurelian and Constantine the Great. What the hell happened?"

Such worthless guineas as Honorius and Valentinian III destroyed the Roman Empire, and got their asses kicked by early badass Krauts like Alaric, Gaiseric and Odoacer. Things got so bad that when the Ostrogoths--that's right--Goths--came to Italy in 489, what was left of the Italians welcomed them with open arms. Oh, how the mighty had fallen...inviting the GOTHS to come take you over!"

S'The Froggies of 1797 were actually led by the only great native Dago Wop since Constantine, a man named Napoleon Bonaparte from the island of Corsica. Showing just how stupid the Wops had become, his own people rejected him, so he went to serve the Froggies. Of course, being leader of the Froggies rubbed off on him eventually, and he did a typical stupid Froggie move by attacking the Russkies in 1812, losing half a million men. His empire fell apart, and the Krauts took over much of Italy again.'

S"The last great Italian--we won't say Dago Wop because he most assuredly wasn't one--was a man named Giuseppe Garibaldi, who helped unify Italy for the first time since the Goths in the 1860s. Alas, the men who came after him were more of the same old degenerate Wops, and Garibaldi wasn't able to make Italy great again. United under one flag for the first time since 568, the Dago Wops nevertheless tottered their way to national disgrace under Mussolini 75 years later."

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata especially in the town of Matera. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilisation and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'The Fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini that took over in 1922 led to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan, and Italian defeat in World War II. In 1946 a referendum on the monarchy resulted in the establishment of a republic. Italy was a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and joined the growing political and economic unification of Western Europe, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. Persistent problems include illegal immigration, the ravages of organized crime (mafia), corruption, high unemployment, and the low incomes and technical standards of southern Italy compared with the more prosperous north.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata especially in the town of Matera. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilisation and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

S'Italy has a diversified industrial economy with approximately the same total and per capita output as France or the United Kingdom. This capitalistic economy (still mitigated by a wide presence of state and governmental influences) remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with substantial unemployment. Most raw materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. For several years Italy has adopted budgets compliant with the requirements of the European Monetary Union (EMU); representatives of government, labor, and employers also agreed to an update of the 1993 "social pact," which has been widely credited with having brought Italy\'s inflation into conformity with EMU requirements. Italy has been urged to work to stimulate employment, promote wage flexibility, hold down the growth in pensions, and tackle the informal economy. Economic growth was 1.3% in 1999 and was expected to edge up to 2.6% in 2000, led by investment and exports. Football is the main national sport. Italy has won the Football World Cup three times: 1934, 1938 and 1982. Some of world\'s best football players and teams come from Italy. The latter include A.C. Milan, Inter Milano FC, A.S. Roma, S.S. Lazio (also from Rome), Juventus (from Turin), and Fiorentina (from Florence).'

S"Italy (Italia) is a republic in the south of Europe, consisting of a boot-shaped peninsula together with two large islands in the Mediterranean Sea: Sicily and Sardinia.  The capital is Rome, but the economic capital is Milan in the north. Other important cities include (in decreasing order of population) Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Venice. The peninsula is extended among Tyrrhenian Sea, Ionian Sea, Adriatic Sea. Italy is one of the countries that use the Euro currency; its national bank is Banca d'Italia, better known as Bankitalia."

S'Its history is perhaps the most important one for the cultural and social development of the Mediterranean area as a whole. This country has had an important prehistoric activity, and archeological sites can be found im many regions: Lazio and Toscana (Etruscan people), Umbria, Basilicata. After Magna Graecia, Etruscan civilization and Roman Empire, and the medieval Humanism, the Renaissance indeed shaped the whole of western art history and Rome contains some of the most important examples of the Baroque. Today Italy is considered a leading reference point for elegance, food, wine, culture, cinema, theatre, literature, poetry, visual arts, music (notably Opera), holidays, and generally speaking, for taste. Italy became a nation-state belatedly - in 1861 when the states of the peninsula and Sicily were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, hitherto ruler of Piedmont and kings of Sardinia. Rome itself remained for a decade under the Papacy, and became part of the Kingdom of Italy only in 1870, final date of the Italian unification. Vatican is now an enclave, like San Marino.'
