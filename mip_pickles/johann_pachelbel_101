Vright|frame|\u000aJohann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.\u000aPachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D; it is the only canon he wrote, and is somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.\u000aPachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, suggesting that he was born in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of 15, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, he studied and served as organist of one of the churches. He was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.\u000aLater he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel became a deputy organist at the Saint Stephen Cathedral (Stephanskirche), Vienna. Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and while there may have known or even taught Pachelbel, whose music shows traces of Kerll's style. \u000aPachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of JS Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, becoming a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and tutoring his children. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt: Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach.\u000aPachelbel only spent one year in Eisenach before his patron's brother died\u2014during the period of mourning court musicians were greatly curtailed and Pachelbel was left without employment. He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678.\u000aIn June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\u2014partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt.\u000aDuring his stay in Erfurt, Pachelbel married twice. He married Barbara Gabler on 25 October 1681, but she and their son died in September 1683 during a plague. Pachelbel married his second wife, Judith Drommer, on 24 August 1684. They had five sons and two daughters. Two of his sons, Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel, also became organ composers; another son, Johann Michael, became an instrument maker.  One of his daughters, Amalia, achieved recognition as a painter and engraver.\u000aEven though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Württemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.\u000aGeorg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\u2014by then a celebrated native of the city\u2014that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death.\u000aDuring his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. \u000aPachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music: The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, some of Pachelbel's organ chaconnes' movements are reminiscent of Kerll's works in the genre - Passacaglia in D minor and Chaconne in C major). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers.\u000aAs a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.\u000aMuch of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals.\u000aSome pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.\u000aThe main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott).\u000aA new model invented by Pachelbel is a small chorale fugue (a fugue where the subject is a part of the chorale melody - usually the first phrase) that is followed by a three- or four-part cantus firmus chorale setting. Chorale phrases are treated one at a time, in the order in which they occur; frequently, the accompanying voices anticipate the next phrase:\u000aPachelbel wrote numerous chorales using this model (Auf meinen lieben Gott, Ach wie elend ist unsre Zeit, Wenn mein Stündlein vorhanden ist, etc), which soon became a standard form.\u000a \u000aA collection of eight chorales called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren was published by Pachelbel in 1693 and contained, among other pieces, several chorales written using ancient techniques: Wir glauben all' an einen Gott, with melodic ornamentation of the chorale melody, Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren (Psalm 103), based on German polyphonic song with cantus firmus in the tenor, and Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns, a bicinium chorale.\u000aThe magnificat fugues mentioned above were composed during Pachelbel's final years in Nuremberg. They form a cycle of some 90 pieces composed for the Magnificat at Vespers. Usually, the latter was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach, so most of his magnificat fugues are pieces based on original themes (rather than those from the chant) and preludial in nature.\u000aThe magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:\u000aNot counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\u2014a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. \u000aOne common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:\u000aOther, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:\u000aHowever, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16.\u000aPachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below).\u000aSince Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude's chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel's most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. \u000aIn 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. \u000aPachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel's first wife's death in the same year. This was Pachelbel's first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg Böhm's works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach's early organ partitas.\u000aOther variation sets include a few arias and an arietta (a short aria) with variations.\u000aMost of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:\u000aThis kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&mdash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&mdash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:\u000aSometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex.\u000aPachelbel composed six fantasias. Three of them (the A minor, C major and one of the two D Dorian pieces) are sectional compositions in 3/2 time, the sections are never connected thematically; the other D Dorian piece's structure is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues, with the main theme accompanied by two simple countersubjects\u000aThe E-flat major and G minor fantasias are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre. Both are gentle free-flowing pieces featuring intricate passages in both hands with many accidentals, close to similar pieces by Girolamo Frescobaldi or Giovanni de Macque.\u000aAlmost all pieces designated as preludes resemble Pachelbel's toccatas closely, since they too feature virtuosic passagework in one or both hands over sustained notes. However, most of the preludes are much shorter than the toccatas: the A minor prelude pictured above only has 9 bars, the G major piece has 10. The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:\u000aA texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint.\u000aPachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite).\u000aAll suites follow the typical German model (Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gigue), but are sometimes updated with an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed than main movements, but offer catchy and memorable melodies.  All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.\u000aPachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing.\u000aMusikalische Ergötzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel's collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.\u000aEach suite of Musikalische Ergötzung begins with an introductory Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and stretti. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner.  The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, but the majority of the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.\u000aPachelbel's other chamber music includes an aria and variations (Aria con variazioni in A major) and three standalone suites scored for a string quartet or a typical French five-part string ensemble with 2 violins, 2 violas and a violone (the latter reinforces the basso continuo). Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement.\u000a: Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany with passages in shorter note values. Here's an example from the ending of Gott ist unser Zuversicht:\u000a* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: \u000a** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.\u000a** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.\u000a** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).\u000a* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.\u000a* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus.\u000aIt is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel's Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion. As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s:\u000a'''Decade\u000a'''1850s\u000a'''1860s\u000a'''1870s\u000a'''1880s\u000a'''1890s\u000a'''1900s\u000a'''1910s\u000a'''1920s\u000a'''1930s\u000a'''1940s\u000a'''1950s\u000a'''1960s\u000a'''1970s\u000a'''1980s\u000a'''1990s\u000a'''Number of Pachelbel references in The NY Times\u000a'''0\u000a'''0\u000a'''1\u000a'''0\u000a'''0\u000a'''1\u000a'''4\u000a'''3\u000a'''29\u000a'''39\u000a'''57\u000a'''100\u000a'''237\u000a'''347\u000a'''217\u000aDuring the 1930s, his organ music, particularly the chorale prelude Vom Himmel hoch, da komm' ich her ("From Heaven Above to Earth I Come", German's most popular carol before Silent Night), began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as organ chorale variations, a motet and a Magnificat.\u000aCanon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."\u000aThus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the 'Canon' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.\u000aSome classical music purists frown upon the Canon if for no other reason than its popularity with the masses who are also unappreciative of Pachelbel's other works.\u000a* Scores:\u000a** \u000a** \u000a

VPachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, suggesting that he was born in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of 15, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, he studied and served as organist of one of the churches. He was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.

VLater he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel became a deputy organist at the Saint Stephen Cathedral (Stephanskirche), Vienna. Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and while there may have known or even taught Pachelbel, whose music shows traces of Kerll's style. Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of JS Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, becoming a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and tutoring his children. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt: Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach.

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\u2014partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt.

Pachelbel married his second wife, Judith Drommer, on 24 August 1684. They had five sons and two daughters. Two of his sons, Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel, also became organ composers; another son, Johann Michael, became an instrument maker.

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\u2014by then a celebrated native of the city\u2014that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death.

VDuring his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music: The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, some of Pachelbel's organ chaconnes' movements are reminiscent of Kerll's works in the genre - Passacaglia in D minor and Chaconne in C major). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers.

VMuch of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals.

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.

VThe magnificat fugues mentioned above were composed during Pachelbel's final years in Nuremberg. They form a cycle of some 90 pieces composed for the Magnificat at Vespers. Usually, the latter was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach, so most of his magnificat fugues are pieces based on original themes (rather than those from the chant) and preludial in nature.

VThe magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\u2014a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16.

VPachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below).

VSince Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude's chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel's most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel's first wife's death in the same year. This was Pachelbel's first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg Böhm's works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach's early organ partitas.

VMost of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&mdash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&mdash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex.

The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:A texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint.

VEach suite of Musikalische Ergötzung begins with an introductory Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and stretti. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner.  The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, but the majority of the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.

VPachelbel's other chamber music includes an aria and variations (Aria con variazioni in A major) and three standalone suites scored for a string quartet or a typical French five-part string ensemble with 2 violins, 2 violas and a violone (the latter reinforces the basso continuo). Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement.

V: Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany with passages in shorter note values. Here's an example from the ending of Gott ist unser Zuversicht:* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus.

VIt is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel's Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion. As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s:'''Decade'''1850s'''1860s'''1870s'''1880s'''1890s'''1900s'''1910s'''1920s'''1930s'''1940s'''1950s'''1960s'''1970s'''1980s'''1990s'''Number of Pachelbel references in The NY Times'''0'''0'''1'''0'''0'''1'''4'''3'''29'''39'''57'''100'''237'''347'''217During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly the chorale prelude Vom Himmel hoch, da komm' ich her ("From Heaven Above to Earth I Come", German's most popular carol before Silent Night), began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as organ chorale variations, a motet and a Magnificat.

VCanon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the 'Canon' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.

VSome classical music purists frown upon the Canon if for no other reason than its popularity with the masses who are also unappreciative of Pachelbel's other works.* Scores:** **

S"Johann Pachelbel (1653 - March 3, 1706) was a German Baroque composer and organist best remembered for his Canon in D, which is often heard at weddings. Pachelbel was organist at Erfurt, in the Thuringian region of Germany and his harmonizations of church chorales seem to have been inspirational to the young Johann Sebastian Bach, whose older brother, Johann Chistoph Bach, had been Pachelbel's organ student. Indeed, Pachelbel seems to have enjoyed close friendships with many members of the Bach family of musicians. Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. In addition to the well-known Canon in D and numerous church hymn settings, Pachelbel wrote a considerable number cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. In addition to the well-known Canon in D and numerous church hymn settings, Pachelbel wrote a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

S"Johann Pachelbel is unfairly viewed as a one-work composer, that work being the popular Canon in D major, for three violins and continuo. He was an important figure from the Baroque period who is now seen as central in the development of both keyboard music and Protestant church music. Some have summarized his primary contribution as the uniting of Catholic Gregorian chant elements with the Northern German organ style, a style that reflected the influence of the Protestant chorale. A Lutheran, he spent several years in Vienna where he was exposed to music by Frohberger and Frescobaldi, which influenced his work with the chorale-prelude. His music in this genre would in turn influence the compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach, among others. It should be noted that many of Pachelbel's works are difficult to date, thus rendering judgments about his stylistic evolution questionable in many cases. Pachelbel was also a gifted organist and harpsichordist."

S'Pachelbel was born in August of 1653. He showed musical talent early on and began studies first with Heinrich Schwemmer and later with George Kaspar Wecker, the latter instructing in composition and on organ. Pachelbel received his general education at St. Lorenz high school, and in 1669 he enrolled at the university in Altdorf. Pachelbel did not come from a wealthy family and earned meager sums serving as organist at the Lorenzkirche. He thus could not garner enough money to keep up with the tuition costs at the university and had to leave after about a year.'

Four years later he took a position as court organist in Eisenach, where Bach would be born in 1685. He would become a close friend of the Bach family and teach both Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph. Pachelbel left after a year at Eisenach however, and became organist at the Predigerkirche in Erfurt, in 1678."

In 1690 Pachelbel took a post as Court organist at Stuttgart and appeared quite satisfied, but left after two years due to an impending invasion by French forces. He served next as municipal organist at Gotha, from the fall of 1692 until April 1695. He returned to Nuremberg around the latter time, eventually to become organist at St. Sebalduskirche (summer, 1695). He would serve for nearly eleven years in this post, producing his most famous vocal scores, as well as his great Magnificat fugues. In 1699 he produced his important collection of six arias, Hexachordum Apollinis, for organ or harpsichord. Pachelbel was buried in Nuremberg on March 9, 1706, and apparently had died on March 3.'

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be programmed regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

However, by May 20, 1977, it is already being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."This table gives number of times Pachelbel is mentioned in The New York Times in each decade:{| border="1" align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"!

S"Johann Pachelbel (August 1653 - March 3, 1706) was a German Baroque composer and organist, best remembered for his Canon in D. Pachelbel was organist at Erfurt, in the Thuringian region of Germany.  He contributed to Protestant church music, especially to music for the keyboard.  Pachelbel's harmonizations of church chorales seem to have been inspirational to the young Johann Sebastian Bach, whose older brother, Johann Christoph Bach, had been Pachelbel's organ student. Indeed, Pachelbel seems to have enjoyed close friendships with many members of the Bach family of musicians. Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. In addition to the well-known Canon and numerous church hymn settings, Pachelbel wrote a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be programmed regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S"Johann Pachelbel (p\xc3\xa4kh'&#601;lb&#277;l) (August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist, best remembered for his Canon in D. Pachelbel was organist at Erfurt, in the Thuringian region of Germany.  He contributed to Protestant church music, especially to music for the keyboard.  Pachelbel's harmonizations of church chorales seem to have been inspirational to the young Johann Sebastian Bach, whose older brother, Johann Christoph Bach, had been Pachelbel's organ student. Indeed, Pachelbel seems to have enjoyed close friendships with many members of the Bach family of musicians. Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. His sons Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel were also both organists and composers."

S"Canon in D aside, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

However, by May 20, 1977, it was already being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on the one hand we have a piece of music that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity amongst Western culture, thus apparently proving the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, on the surface of it we may also be said to have a piece of music which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would of course indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"Media:Example.oggMedia:Example.ogg----Johann Pachelbel (p\xc3\xa4kh'&#601;lb&#277;l) (August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist, best remembered for his Canon in D. Pachelbel was organist at Erfurt, in the Thuringian region of Germany.  He contributed to Protestant church music, especially to music for the keyboard.  Pachelbel's harmonizations of church chorales seem to have been inspirational to the young Johann Sebastian Bach, whose older brother, Johann Christoph Bach, had been Pachelbel's organ student. Indeed, Pachelbel seems to have enjoyed close friendships with many members of the Bach family of musicians. Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godmother for Ambrosius Bach's son (Johann Sebastian's ex wife Johanna Judith Bach. His sons Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel were also both organists and composers."

Pachelbel's harmonizations of church chorales seem to have been inspirational to the young Johann Sebastian Bach, whose older brother, Johann Christoph Bach, had been Pachelbel's organ student. Indeed, Pachelbel seems to have enjoyed close friendships with many members of the Bach family of musicians. Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. His sons Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel were also both organists and composers."

S"Canon in D aside, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was already being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on the one hand we have a piece of music that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity amongst Western culture, thus apparently proving the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, on the surface of it we may also be said to have a piece of music which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would of course indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

Pachelbel served in the capelle in Eisenach, the home city of Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children including Johann Sebastian and Johann Christoph, for a year in the 1670s. Pachelbel also stood as godfather for Ambrosius Bach's daughter (Johann Sebastian's sister) Johanna Judith Bach. His sons Wilhelm Hieronymus Pachelbel and Charles Theodore Pachelbel were also both organists and composers."

S"Canon in D aside, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg. He was baptized September 1, 1653, which indicates he was most certainly born in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of St Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties."

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outisde the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the St Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence was found to prove this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

S"Pachelbel only spent one year in Eisenach before his patron's brother died - during the period of mourning court musicians were greatly curtailed and Pachelbel was left without employment. He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso'). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt - partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes (to play a prelude based on a specific chorale's melody before the singing of this chorale, so he chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his period at Erfurt), and composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist."

S"Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from 1 September 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November. On 20 April 1695 Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of St Sebald in Nuremberg, died. The city authorities were anxious to appoint Pachelbel, a celebrated native of the city: the position at St Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Pachelbel had received an official invitation from St Sebald and accepted it He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November. Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of St Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were anxious to appoint Pachelbel, a celebrated native of the city: the position at St Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Pachelbel had received an official invitation from St Sebald and accepted it He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"Beside Canon in D, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

S"Beside Canon in D, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant), and around 70 chorale preludes that demonstrated Pachelbel's knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies and developed a new compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form. Other works include fugues and ricercars for organ, a number of chorale variations (sometimes called partitas for organ), around twenty suites for harpsichord, a considerable number of cantatas for the Lutheran church and chamber sonatas for various instruments, especially the violin."

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist, now best remembered for his Canon in D. Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg, baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties."

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Predigekirche (Preacher's Church) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes.  Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist."

S'Beside Canon in D, Pachelbel is known for his works for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant).  He wrote Around 70 chorale preludes using knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies.  He developed a compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form.'

During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes.

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Predigekirche (Preacher's Church) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes.  Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes.  Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

It was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel wrote primarily for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant).  He wrote Around 70 chorale preludes using knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies.  He developed a compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form.'

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

S'Although he has composed a large body of works, Pachelbel is best known in modern times for his Canon in D. Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes.

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'Pachelbel wrote primarily for organ: he composed more than two hundred pieces for the instrument. These include 95 magnificat fugues, most of which are based on invented themes and are brief pieces that were used to establish the pitch for the singers (whereas magnificat fugues were usually based on themes from the Magnificat, building upon a particular verse from the chant).  He wrote Around 70 chorale preludes using knowledge of contemporary techniques for setting chorale melodies.  He developed a compositional pattern that subsequently became a standard form.'

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularily the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal required. This is partly due to the fact that Lutheran religious practice included domestic worship services, where participants sang chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords were used to accompany the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries used simple methods for their chorales and chorale preludes in order to make them playable on said instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs that Pachelbel had at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops, two manuals and pedal (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals and pedal), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals and pedal."

S"The biggest part of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous chorale preludes Pachelbel composed during his years in Erfurt (see above). The pieces tend to use three or four voices and present the chorale melody is a clear, recognizable form. Pachelbel used chorale models common for his time and invented one of his own: a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody, and a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting. The prelude is constructed using themes derived from the main chorale melody, these themes - chorale phrases - are treated imitatively (one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices) and in the order in which they occur. So the entire prelude can be seen as a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S":In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces of the collection demonstrated that Pachelbel could also use ancient techniques for chorale composition: chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the chorale melody (Wir glauben all an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the two-part bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heilund der von uns).* 95 magnificat fugues. Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude that would help establish the pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are based on original themes (rather than on themes from the chant). The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

It is generally assumed that this collection was composed after, and influenced by, his first wife\'s death.* several dozens of toccatas, preludes and fugues.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than that of his famous contemporaries, Buxtehude and Biber. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S': Each suite of Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung begins with an introductory Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are marked Allegro and are three-voice fughettas and strettos. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They are marked Adagio and contain two sections that juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes written in a non-imitative manner, the second employs for the violins an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, but the majority of the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne and the fourth suite contains two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's other chamber music includes an aria and variations (Aria con variazioni in A major) and three standalone suites scored for a string quartet or a typical French five-part string ensemble with 2 violins, 2 violas and a violone (the latter is used to reinforce the basso continuo). Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

S'Although he has composed a large body of works, Pachelbel is best known in modern times for his Canon in D. Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Predigekirche (Preacher's Church) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

It is generally assumed that this collection was composed after, and influenced by, his first wife\'s death.* several dozens of toccatas, preludes and fugues.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than that of his famous contemporaries, Buxtehude and Biber. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, his organ music, particularly "From Heaven on High To Earth I Come," began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as "Seven Chorale Partitas" for organ, a motet, and a Magnificat.'

S'The Canon was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

It is generally assumed that this collection was composed after, and influenced by, his first wife\'s death.* several dozens of toccatas, preludes and fugues.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than that of his famous contemporaries, Buxtehude and Biber. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'As tracked by mentions in The New York Times, Pachelbel was all but unknown to United States audiences before the 1930s. During the 1930s, however, his organ music, particularly the chorale prelude Von Himmel hoch, da komm\' ich her ("From Heaven Above to Earth I Come", German\'s most popular carol before Silent Night), began to be played regularly by church organists during the Christmas season, and performances of other works are occasionally mentioned, such as organ chorale variations, a motet and a Magnificat.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form.

Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

It is generally assumed that this collection was composed after, and influenced by, his first wife\'s death.* several dozens of toccatas, preludes and fugues.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than that of his famous contemporaries, Buxtehude and Biber. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'It is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel\'s Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion.

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'Not surprisingly, Pachelbel\'s affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured compared to earlier works in the genre (for instance Kerll\'s Chaconne in C major or Passacaglia in D minor), though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They display a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces. Particularily the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations (four were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death", the title might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year)), a couple of arias and an arietta (a short aria) with variations. Pachelbel\'s chorale variations may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Pachelbel's other organ works include:* around 20-30 fugues. Many of these works make use of imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are very varied in form: some are incredibly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see the C major fugue in the Media section below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement - a technique extensively used by Bach.* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. Although the C minor one is the most popular of these and is frequently performed and recorded, Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically. It is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system that handles the notes D sharp, A sharp, E sharp, and B sharp well, which is not the case with meantone temperament used in Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used an own tuning system, of which we know nothing.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas and several preludes. Pachelbel's fantasias and toccatas mostly pay tribute to older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and are sequences of sections that are not connected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas receive more attention than the rest."

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than that of his famous contemporaries, Buxtehude and Biber. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'It is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel\'s Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion.

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

This was an old notation system in which note heads weren't filled in and bar lines weren't used. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation to emphasize his efforts to compose in an old, outdated style."

S'Not surprisingly, Pachelbel\'s affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured compared to earlier works in the genre (for instance Kerll\'s Chaconne in C major or Passacaglia in D minor), though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They display a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces. Particularily the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations (four were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death", the title might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year)), a couple of arias and an arietta (a short aria) with variations. Pachelbel\'s chorale variations may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic compared to Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 ingressus settings and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are concertato and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'It is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel\'s Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion.

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works - arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos - and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced already in his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly has studied Kerll's music - Kerll's influence is obvious even to an unexperienced listener (one might want to compare Kerll's famous Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias, or trace some of the elements of Pachelbel's chaconnes in Passacaglia in D minor by Kerll). Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation form and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations, the work he was most proud of, dedicating it to Dietrich Buxtehude, was a collection of keyboard variations, and variation techniques are used in many of his organ works. Even the famous Canon in D is, in fact, a set of variations.'

S'Not surprisingly, Pachelbel\'s affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured compared to earlier works in the genre (for instance Kerll\'s Chaconne in C major or Passacaglia in D minor), though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They display a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces. Particularily the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations (four were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death", the title might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year)), a couple of arias and an arietta (a short aria) with variations. Pachelbel\'s chorale variations may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo's lyre), which is regarded by many as Pachelbel's masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six different keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to a friend, Ferdinand Tobias Richter, and to Pachelbel's famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima, Aria secunda, Aria tertia, etc. Aria sexta, the final piece, has a subtitle Aria Sebaldina, an obvious reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight and other arias all have six variations."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. This music is influenced by the French style and shows that Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically the suites are quite varied: Pachelbel used 17 keys for these pieces, including the key of F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music (it was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'All suites follow the typical German model (Allemande - Courante - Sarabande - Gigue), but update it with frequent use of an extra movement between the courante and the sarabande, usually a gavotte or a ballet. Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed compared to main movements, however offer catchy, more memorable melodies. All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic compared to Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a rather simple theme. 28 variations of the original melody are heard in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody is sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany it feature fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. An important feature of these works is that some of them feature unusual, large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts,** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody, and ** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (the opening parts of Vespers that come before the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and incredibly diverse: from a more known D major one written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this music displays Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'It is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel\'s Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion.

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Interestingly, it is the only canon he ever wrote and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Beside Canon in D, his most known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dietrich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops, two manuals and pedals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals and pedals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals and pedals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist.* In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the two-part bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heilund der von uns).* 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'Not surprisingly, Pachelbel\'s affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre (for instance Kerll\'s Chaconne in C major or Passacaglia in D minor), though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes.  They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces:  the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work.  Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations:  four were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death").  The title might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year.  There were also a couple of arias and an arietta (a short aria) with variations. Pachelbel\'s chorale variations may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

Generally, these additional movements are uncomplicated and less developed than main movements, but offer catchy and memorable melodies.  All movements are in binary form, except for two arias.'

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a simple theme, though 28 variations of the melody are in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S': Each suite of Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung begins with an introductory Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and strettos. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner.  The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, but the majority of the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.'

Of these, the five-part suite in G major (Partie a 5 in G major) is a variation suite, where each movement begins with a theme from the opening sonatina; like its four-part cousin (Partie a 4 in G major) and the third standalone suite (Partie a 4 in F-sharp minor) it updates the German suite model by using the latest French dances such as the gavotte or the ballet. All three Partie end with a Finale movement."

S": Interestingly, Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany featuring fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dietrich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist.* In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the two-part bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heilund der von uns).* 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dietrich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a simple theme, though 28 variations of the melody are in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S": Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany featuring fugal passages written using shorter values.* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (c. August 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops, two manuals and pedalboard (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals and pedalboard), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals and pedalboard."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the two-part bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heilund der von uns).* 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon itself consists of an ostinato bass line, over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a simple theme, though 28 variations of the melody are in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel  (p\xc3\xa4kh'\xc9\x99lb\xc4\x95l) (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was a German baroque composer and organist. He was an acclaimed composer and organist during his lifetime, and was also regarded as an outstanding teacher. Today Pachelbel is considered to be one of the most important organ composers of the middle Baroque: he made significant contributions to the development of chorale prelude and fugue and brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak."

Beside Canon in D, his best known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon, based on a simple theme, though 28 variations of the melody are in the piece. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

Besides Canon in D, his best known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'Although he composed a large body of work, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. Besides Canon in D, his best known works include Chaconne in F minor, Toccata in C minor (both for organ) and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald, and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches.

In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (it is an interesting fact that Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of Kerll. However, no substantial evidence proves this). Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel went to Vienna where he became a deputy organist of the Saint Stephen Cathedral (Stephanskirche). Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and since Pachelbel's music shows traces of Kerll's style, it is possible that Pachelbel was a student of his. However, no substantial evidence proves this. Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy, before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of Johann Ambrosius Bach and birthplace of his many children), became a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and began tutoring his children the same year. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt (see below): Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach music."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. Many of these works make use of musical imitation and variation techniques. The fugues are highly variable in form: some unexpectedly short pieces with subjects that use fast repeated notes (see "C major fugue" below), others are full-fledged fugues. In two works (Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major) the fugue is preceded by a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach.* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel\'s fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest.'

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt's Predigekirche organ had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein Stuendlein vorhanden ist."

S"Pachelbel's other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. For instance, the subject of an A minor piece is:* Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel's fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest."

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the two-part bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns).* 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"During his lifetime, Pachelbel was best known as an organ composer. He wrote more than two hundred organ pieces, both liturgical and secular, and used most of the genres that existed at the time. His other keyboard music includes harpsichord suites and sets of variations. Pachelbel also composed numerous vocal works: arias, Magnificat settings, motets, sacred concertos, and chamber music, most of which is in partita form. Pachelbel's music shows influence of Italian and Southern German composers of the time. Italian influence can be traced to his earliest datable works (two arias composed in 1679, So ist denn dies der Tag and So ist denn nur die Treu). He almost certainly studied Johann Caspar von Kerll's music:  The similarities are compelling even for inexperienced listeners (for example, Kerll's Toccata Cromatica con Durezze e Ligature and Pachelbel's fantasias or chaconnes in D minor).  Other influences probably included Johann Jakob Froberger and various French composers."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches.

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S'In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"Pachelbel's other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. :One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece::However, these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12: * Three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known.* 6 fantasias, around 20 toccatas, and several preludes.  Pachelbel's fantasias and toccatas tribute older styles and musicians, reminiscent of works by Kerll, Froberger and Frescobaldi. Three fantasias use the old non-thematic style and have sections unconnected in any way. The toccatas usually consist of fast passages for both hands over sustained pedal chords. All are very accessible works, particularily the E minor and C minor toccatas which receive more attention than the rest."

The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S'Pachelbel\'s other organ works include:* 20 to 30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn\'t yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach\'s works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. :One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece::However, these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12: * around 20 toccatas. Most of these consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here\'s the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex.* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel\'s toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel\'s magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S"Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. :One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece::However, these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12: Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S'Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel\'s toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel\'s magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. In 1699 Pachbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented some of his own:  a combination of a small chorale fugue in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody.  Also a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting in which the prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively, one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices and in the same order.  So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece:However, these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'It is sometimes supposed that classical music is intrinsically timeless and is not subject to the caprices of fashion. Pachelbel\'s Canon may be said to both support and refute this assertion.

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): * 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece:However, these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces. These are:* around 70 chorale preludes, including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt (see above). They tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. Pachelbel used common chorale models and invented one of his own. This new form is combines a small chorale fugue, in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody, and a three- or four-part cantus firmus setting. The prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively&ndash;one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices&ndash;and in the order in which they occur. So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): * 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches.

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): * 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, etc. All these fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S": Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany featuring fugal passages written using shorter values. Here's an example from the ending of Gott ist unser Zuversicht:* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): * 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. Magnificat fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre.

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S": In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition:  chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): * 95 magnificat fugues.  Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach: his magnificat fugues are brief pieces, preludial in nature, and most are original themes rather than those from the chant. The fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. Magnificat fugues were composed during Pachelbel's years in Nuremberg."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Other organ works include:* three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S": Gott ist unser Zuversicht and Nun danket alle Gott both feature endings that are four-part chorale settings reminiscent of Pachelbel's organ chorale model. Here the chorale melody sung by the sopranos is presented in long note values, and three lower parts that accompany with passages in shorter note values. Here's an example from the ending of Gott ist unser Zuversicht:* 11 sacred concertos, many in concertato style. These works significantly feature unusually large groups of instruments: Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (in C) uses four trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, 3 violas, violone and basso continuo, while Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum is scored for a five-part chorus, two flutes, bassoon, five trumpets, trombone, drums, cymbals, harp, two violins, basso continuo and organ. Stylistically, Pachelbel's sacred concertos present a diversity of styles: ** Gott ist unser Zuversicht, Gott sei uns gnaedig and Lobet den Herrn in seinem Heiligtum are settings of psalm texts.** Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan and Christ lug in Todesbanden are chorale concertos, the former being a series of six variations on the chorale melody.** Kommt her zu mir is a work that closely resembles a church cantata (which did not exist as a genre at the time).* 2 masses. One is probably an early work in the concertato style, and the other (Missa brevis) is a small mass in three movements, simple, unadorned and reminiscent of his motets.* 24 pieces for use with Vespers: 11 settings of ingressus (Vesper openings preceding the hymn) and 13 magnificats. All the ingressus break the text and the music into 6 parts and are written in concertato style. Two Magnificat settings are in motet style, the rest are in concertato style, influenced by Italian Catholic music and amazingly diverse:  from a more known D major piece written for a 4-part choir, 4 violas and basso continuo, to the Magnificat in C major scored for a five-part chorus, 4 trumpets, timpani, 2 violins, a single viola and two violas da gamba, bassoon, basso continuo and organ. Most of this has Italian influence, and some parts of the magnificats make use of older techniques like the plainchant cantus firmus."

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were.

Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see above).* 6 fantasias. Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the Wurttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales with preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. He used common chorale models and invented one of his own. This new form is combines a small chorale fugue, in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody, and a three- or four-part cantus firmus chorale setting. The prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively&ndash;one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices&ndash;and in the order in which they occur. So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S"In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces in this collection demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition: chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns): Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach, so most of his magnificat fugues are pieces based on original themes (rather than those from the chant) and preludial in nature. They were all composed during Pachelbel's final years in Nuremberg. The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales with preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. He used common chorale models and invented one of his own. This new form is combines a small chorale fugue, in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody, and a three- or four-part cantus firmus chorale setting. The prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively&ndash;one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices&ndash;and in the order in which they occur. So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales with preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form. He used common chorale models and invented one of his own. This new form is combines a small chorale fugue, in which the subject is a part of the chorale melody, and a three- or four-part cantus firmus chorale setting. The prelude is constructed from themes derived from the main melody; these themes (chorale phrases) are treated imitatively&ndash;one at a time, each preceded by an imitation in the accompanying voices&ndash;and in the order in which they occur. So the prelude is a series of fugal expositions, each based on a chorale phrase. Examples include Auf meinen lieben Gott and Wenn mein St\xc3\xbcndlein vorhanden ist."

S"In 1693 Pachelbel published a collection of eight chorale preludes called Acht Chorale zum Praeambulieren. The pieces in this collection demonstrate ancient techniques for chorale composition: chorales based on melodic ornamentation of the melody (Wir glauben all' an einen Gott), chorales based on German polyphonic song (Nun lob, mein Seel, den Herren, Psalm 103), and the bicinium chorale (Jesus Christus, unser Heiland der von uns)."

S"Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach, so most of his magnificat fugues are pieces based on original themes (rather than those from the chant) and preludial in nature. They were all composed during Pachelbel's final years in Nuremberg. The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. Usually they are three or four notes long, like in this subject of an A minor piece:While this technique is not uncommon in organ fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long - from 5 or 6 repeated notes to 8 in the subject of Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 and 12 in the Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 subject. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Each suite of Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung begins with an introductory Sonata or Sonatina in one movement. In suites 1 and 3 these introductory movements are Allegro three-voice fughettas and stretti. The other four sonatas are reminiscent of French overtures. They have two Adagio sections which juxtapose slower and faster rhythms: the first section uses patterns of dotted quarter and eighth notes in a non-imitative manner.  The second employs the violins in an imitative, sometimes homophonic structure, that uses shorter note values. The dance movements of the suites show traces of Italian (in the gigues of suites 2 and 6) and German (allemande appears in suites 1 and 2) influence, but the majority of the movements are clearly influenced by the French style. The suites do not adhere to a fixed structure: the allemande is only present in two suites, the gigues in four, two suites end with a chaconne, and the fourth suite contains two arias.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S"Usually, the Magnificat at Vespers was either accompanied by the organist playing alternate verses from the chant or preceded by a short organ prelude to establish pitch for the singers. Pachelbel chose the latter approach, so most of his magnificat fugues are pieces based on original themes (rather than those from the chant) and preludial in nature. They were all composed during Pachelbel's final years in Nuremberg. The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present."

S'In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to friend Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Pachelbel\'s famous contemporary Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are named Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth").  The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Most are in three or four voices, and a few pieces are simple bicinia. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, similar to pedal toccatas by Frescobaldi and Froberger. For example, here's the opening of a C major toccata:Although a few toccatas contain more complex passages, the majority are of the same level of complexity. In fact, many go even further and frequently resort to bars full of consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works, however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&ndash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&ndash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three use the old non-thematic fantasia style and have sections unconnected in any way, two are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre, one is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues.* a few preludes. One of the two D minor preludes again features consecutive thirds and sixths; other pieces are highly varied in style but all are improvisational in character. Some of them are extremely short: the G major prelude has 10 bars and the A minor only 9. Pachelbel's only known pieces written specifically for harpsichord are 21 dance suites composed around 1683. These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&ndash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&ndash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

One of the D minor pieces exhibits a lot of similarities with Pachelbel's later simple toccatas, others tend to be more complex. In the ending of another D minor piece and in Prelude in A minor Pachelbel uses a more dense contrapuntal kind of writing, with an improvisational feel to it. Most of the preludes are quite short: the A minor prelude mentioned above only has 9 bars, the G major has 10."

Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&ndash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&ndash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

However, most of the preludes are much shorter than the toccatas: the A minor prelude pictured above only has 9 bars, the G major piece has 10. The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:A texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint."

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. His contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Although he composed a large body of sacred and secular music, Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D. It is the only canon he wrote, and somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, which strongly indicates birth in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of fifteen, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, Pachelbel was both studying and serving as organist of one of the churches. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

S"Georg Caspar Wecker, Pachelbel's former teacher and organist of the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg, died on April 20, 1695. The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&ndash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&ndash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three of them (the A minor, C major and one of the two D Dorian pieces) are sectional compositions in 3/2 time, the sections are never connected thematically; the other D Dorian piece's structure is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues, with the main theme accompanied by two simple countersubjectsThe E-flat major and G minor fantasias are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre. Both are gentle free-flowing pieces featuring intricate passages in both hands with many accidentals, close to similar pieces by Girolamo Frescobaldi or Giovanni de Macque."

However, most of the preludes are much shorter than the toccatas: the A minor prelude pictured above only has 9 bars, the G major piece has 10. The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:A texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint."

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'right|frame|Johann Christoph Pachelbel [] (baptized September 1, 1653 &ndash; March 3, 1706) was an acclaimed Baroque composer, organist and teacher who brought the Southern German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque.'

S'Pachelbel is now best known for his Canon in D; it is the only canon he wrote, and is somewhat unrepresentative of the rest of his oeuvre. In addition to the canon, his most well-known works include the Chaconne in F minor and the Toccata in C minor for organ, and a set of keyboard variations called Hexachordum Apollinis.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, suggesting that he was born in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of 15, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, he studied and served as organist of one of the churches. He was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

S"In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of Preacher's Church (Predigerkirche) in Erfurt, where he remained for twelve years. Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&ndash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&ndash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Both are gentle free-flowing pieces featuring intricate passages in both hands with many accidentals, close to similar pieces by Girolamo Frescobaldi or Giovanni de Macque."

However, most of the preludes are much shorter than the toccatas: the A minor prelude pictured above only has 9 bars, the G major piece has 10. The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:A texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint."

Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'

S'Pachelbel was born in Nuremberg and baptized September 1, 1653, suggesting that he was born in August. He received early musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, Cantor of the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche), and Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church. At the age of 15, Pachelbel entered the university of Altdorf. During his stay in Altdorf, he studied and served as organist of one of the churches. He was forced to leave the university after less than a year because of financial difficulties.'

S"Later he became a scholarship student at the Gymnasium poeticum at Regensburg, where the school authorities, impressed by Pachelbel's academic qualifications and his advanced standing in music, permitted him to study music outside the gymnasium under Kaspar Prentz, a student of Johann Kaspar Kerll. In 1673 Pachelbel became a deputy organist at the Saint Stephen Cathedral (Stephanskirche), Vienna. Kerll moved to Vienna in 1673 as well, and while there may have known or even taught Pachelbel, whose music shows traces of Kerll's style. Pachelbel spent several years in Vienna, absorbing the music of composers from southern Germany and Italy before moving to Eisenach in 1677, where he found employment as court organist under Kapellmeister Daniel Eberlin, in the employ of Prince Johann Georg, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach. He met the Bach family in Eisenach (home city of JS Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, becoming a close friend of Johann Ambrosius and tutoring his children. This friendship continued when Pachelbel moved to Erfurt: Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius' daughter, Johanna Juditha, and taught Johann Christoph Bach."

He requested a testimonial from Eberlin, who wrote one for him (in the document, Eberlin described Pachelbel as a 'perfect and rare virtuoso' - einen perfecten und raren Virtuosen). With this document, Pachelbel left Eisenach on 18 May 1678."

Having already established his reputation as one of the most accomplished organists and composers of his time during his stay in Eisenach, Pachelbel became one of the leading German composers for organ when he was in Erfurt\xe2\x80\x94partly due to the fact that his job duties specifically included composing (not improvising) chorale preludes, as well as composing a large scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as organist. Chorale preludes became the most characteristic products of his time at Erfurt."

S'Even though Pachelbel was outstandingly successful as organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked for a permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment. He was formally released on 15 August 1690, and found employment in less than two weeks: from September 1, 1690 he was musician and organist at the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. The position was an improvement, but very soon Pachelbel was forced to flee before a French invasion. He returned to Nuremberg, then travelled to Gotha where he became town organist on 8 November.'

The city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x94by then a celebrated native of the city\xe2\x80\x94that the position at Saint Sebald, the most important of its kind in Nuremberg, was not filled by examination, nor were the organists of the city's lesser churches invited to apply. Instead, Pachelbel had received an official invitation from Saint Sebald and accepted it. He asked Gotha authorities to release him and arrived in Nuremberg sometime during summer 1695, his road expenses paid by the Nuremberg city council. He remained in Nuremberg until his death."

S'As a composer, Pachelbel apparently was most interested in variation forms and associated techniques. His first published work was a set of chorale variations.  He dedicated to Dieterich Buxtehude the work he was most proud of, a collection of keyboard variations.  Variation techniques are in many of his organ works.  The famous Canon in D is a set of variations.'

S"Much of Pachelbel's liturgical organ music, particularly the chorale preludes, is relatively simple and written for manuals only, no pedal is required. This is partly due to Lutheran religious practice where congregants sang the chorales. Household instruments like virginals or clavichords accompanied the singing, so Pachelbel and many of his contemporaries made music playable using these instruments. The quality of the organs Pachelbel used also played a role. None of the organs at his disposal survived, but we know that the Erfurt instrument had 27 stops and two manuals (compare to the famous Silbermann organs that sometimes had more than 50 stops on three manuals), and Pachelbel's organ in the Church of Saint Sebald in Nuremberg had only 14 stops on two manuals."

S'Some pieces (several chorales, all ricercars, some fantasias) are written in white mensural notation [http://ieee.uwaterloo.ca/praetzel/mp3-cd/info/raybro/index1.html]. This notation system has hollow note heads and omits bar lines (measure delimiters). It was widely used since the 15th century but was being dropped in favor of modern notation (sometimes called black notation) during the 16th-17th centuries. In most cases Pachelbel used white notation for pieces composed in old-fashioned styles, to provide artistic integrity, as it were. In chorales, he may have used the notation to make the works more familiar to performers and musicians, most of whom were not used to the modern system.'

S"The main body of Pachelbel's organ oeuvre consists of liturgical pieces: around 70 chorales and chorale preludes (including numerous pieces composed in Erfurt, see above) and around 95 magnificat fugues (discussed below). Pachelbel's chorales tend to use three or four voices and feature the chorale melody in clear recognizable form, usually as a cantus firmus in the soprano or the bass. A few pieces are brief fughettas based on the chorale melody (Komm, heiliger Geist, Herre Gott)."

S"The magnificat fugues are organized according to the eight Church Modes: 23 in primi toni, 10 in secundi toni, 11 in tertii toni, 8 in quarti toni, 12 in quniti toni, 10 in sexti toni, 8 in septimi toni and 13 in octavi toni. All are original compositions except for four quinti toni pieces that are transposed versions of four tertii toni pieces. The majority of these pieces are in three voices, with a few two- and four-voice fugues present. Most are comparatively short, straightforward pieces; exceptions include a few double fugues. Fugue subjects range from some extremely simple 1-measure ones to extravagant sequences like this, the subject of Magnificat Fugue sexti toni No. 10:Not counting the magnificat pieces, Pachelbel composed around 20-30 fugues, most in three or four voices, and a few pieces that are simple bicinia. At the time, the fugue hasn't yet evolved into its mature form (as seen and heard in Johann Sebastian Bach's works), and Pachelbel was one of the composers who helped define it. So it is not surprising that quite a few of these pieces can be classified as imitative ricercars rather than strict fugues. Pachelbel was also one of the first composers to combine a fugue with a preludial movement\xe2\x80\x94a technique extensively used by Bach. This happens, for instance, in Prelude and Fugue in E minor and Toccata and Fugue in B flat major. One common feature seen in many Pachelbel fugues (both free and magnificat ones) is the use of subjects that either begin with or contain strings of repeated notes. While this technique is not uncommon in keyboard fugues of the era, with Pachelbel these sequences can be unusually long. For instance, here's the subject of a G minor fugue, with a string of six repeated notes:Other, more extreme examples are found in magnificat fugues: Magnificat Fugue quarti toni No. 4 has eight repeated notes in its subject and Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 6 has 12. Even a fugue with an ordinary subject can rely on strings of repeated notes, as it happens, for example, in Magnificat Fugue octavi toni No. 12:However, the most impressive example of this technique is not found in fugues but in the first setting of the Vom Himmel hoch chorale, where a string of 30 repeated sixteenth notes occurs in bars 15-16."

S"Pachelbel also composed three ricercars. All three are polythematic and marked alla breve. The C minor is the most popular and frequently performed and recorded.  Ricercare in F-sharp minor is far more interesting musically; it is in a key rarely used in Baroque music and requires a tuning system with D-sharp, A-sharp, E-sharp, and B-sharp, which is not the case with meantone temperament of the Baroque era. This means that Pachelbel may have used his own tuning system, of which little is known. Ricercare in C major is probably an early work, and employs the same kind of writing with consecutive thirds and sixths as seen in Pachelbel's toccatas (see below)."

S'Since Pachelbel composed mostly for organ, it is not surprising that his affinity for variation form manifests itself primarily in his organ works, particularily in six organ chaconnes. These pieces are more complicated and better structured than earlier works in the genre, though not as harmonically complex nor as virtuosic as, for example, Buxtehude\'s chaconnes. They have a wide variety of moods and are among Pachelbel\'s most well-known organ pieces: the Chaconne in F minor is often cited as his best organ work. In 1699 Pachelbel published a music collection entitled Hexachordum Apollinis (a reference to Apollo\'s lyre), which is widely regarded as Pachelbel\'s masterpiece. It contains six arias with variations in six keys, playable on harpsichord or organ. The collection is dedicated to composers Ferdinand Tobias Richter and Dieterich Buxtehude. The arias are numbered Aria prima through Aria sexta ("first" through "sixth"). The final piece is subtitled Aria Sebaldina, a reference to the Church of Saint Sebald where Pachelbel worked at the time and where he received his first music lessons. Aria secunda has five variations, Aria Sebaldina has eight; the others have six variations. Pachelbel also composed several sets of chorale variations. Four of these were published in Erfurt in 1683 under the title Musikalische Sterbensgedanken ("Musical Thoughts on Death"), which might refer to Pachelbel\'s first wife\'s death in the same year. This was Pachelbel\'s first published work and it is now partially lost. These pieces, along with Georg B\xc3\xb6hm\'s works, may or may not have influenced Johann Sebastian Bach\'s early organ partitas.'

S"Most of Pachelbel's toccatas (of which there are about 20) consist of relatively fast passagework in both hands over sustained pedal notes or chords, more or less similar to pedal toccatas by Girolamo Frescobaldi and Johann Jakob Froberger:This kind of writing is frequently seen preceded by passages that are improvisational in nature, like the beginning of Toccata in E minor, one of Pachelbel's more known pieces. However, Pachelbel's later works in the genre exhibit a much simpler style, in which only two voices interact over sustained pedal notes, and said interaction&mdash;already much simpler than the virtuosic passages in earlier works&mdash;sometimes resorts to consecutive thirds, sixths or tenths:Sometimes a bar or two of consecutive thirds embellish the otherwise more complex toccata, occasionally there's a whole section written in that manner, and a few toccatas (particularly one of the D minor and one of the G minor pieces) are composed using only this technique, with almost no variation. Partly due to their simplicity, the toccatas are very accessible works; however, the E minor and C minor ones which receive more attention than the rest are in fact slightly more complex."

Three of them (the A minor, C major and one of the two D Dorian pieces) are sectional compositions in 3/2 time, the sections are never connected thematically; the other D Dorian piece's structure is reminiscent of Pachelbel's magnificat fugues, with the main theme accompanied by two simple countersubjectsThe E-flat major and G minor fantasias are variations on the Italian toccata di durezze e ligature genre. Both are gentle free-flowing pieces featuring intricate passages in both hands with many accidentals, close to similar pieces by Girolamo Frescobaldi or Giovanni de Macque."

However, most of the preludes are much shorter than the toccatas: the A minor prelude pictured above only has 9 bars, the G major piece has 10. The only exception is one of the two D minor pieces, which is very similar to Pachelbel's late simplistic toccatas, and considerably longer than any other prelude. The toccata idiom is completely absent, however, in the short Prelude in A minor:A texture of similar density is also found in the ending of the shorter D minor piece, where three voices engage in imitative counterpoint."

These are French influenced and indicate Pachelbel may have studied Froberger's keyboard suites. Harmonically, the suites are quite varied: 17 keys are in these pieces, including F-sharp minor, which was seldom used in baroque music.  (It was difficult to use because of meantone temperament. Pachelbel's other pieces in the same key include an organ ricercare and a chamber suite)."

S"Pachelbel's chamber music is much less virtuosic than Biber's Mystery Sonatas or Buxtehude's Opus 1 and Opus 2 chamber sonatas. The famous Canon in D belongs to this genre, as it was originally scored for 3 violins and a basso continuo, and paired with a gigue in the same key. The canon is actually more of a chaconne or a passacaglia: it consists of a ground bass over which the violins play a three-voice canon based on a simple theme, the violins' parts form 28 variations of the melody. The gigue which originally accompanied the canon is a simplistic piece that uses strict fugal writing."

S'Musikalische Erg\xc3\xb6tzung ("Musical Delight") is a set of six chamber suites for two scordatura violins and basso continuo published sometime after 1695. At the time, scordatura tuning was used to produce special effects and execute tricky passages. However, Pachelbel\'s collection was intended for amateur violinists, and scordatura tuning is used here as basic introduction to the technique. Scrodatura only involves the tonic, dominant and sometimes the subdominant notes.'

S'Canon in D was first mentioned on March 15, 1871, and the context, "a Bach fugue and a Pachelbel canon" suggests that the work was not familiar. However, by May 20, 1977, it was being referred to as "the famous Pachelbel canon."Thus, on one hand the Canon is a musical piece that, entirely divorced from its temporal context, managed to attain wide popularity in Western culture, thus supporting the "timelessness" of classical music.  However, it may also be said to be a piece which went unnoticed in its own time and which, with the changes in vogue and popular culture in later years, underwent a change of fortunes; in effect, its time had come.  The latter understanding would indicate that, like everything else, classical music (and the \'Canon\' is certainly a classic in all senses of the word) is subject to changes in fashion.'
