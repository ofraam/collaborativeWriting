VThe violin is a stringed musical instrument comprising four strings tuned a fifth apart. It is the smallest and highest-tuned member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola, cello and double bass. The lowest string (and hence the lowest note) is the G just below middle C, then in ascending order D, A and E. \u000a \u000aSheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). \u000aThe violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. \u000aA person who plays violin is called a violinist. \u000aThe violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The sides of the violin, curiously, are called ribs.  The belly is reinforced by an internal bass bar, which runs vertically through the instrument underneath the lowest string.  \u000aThe four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across an intricately carved wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard.  At the top end of the fingerboard, the strings cross the nut, a very small second bridge, mounted just slightly above the fingerboard.  They then enter the pegbox, where they are wound around their tuning pegs, which are mounted sideways through tightly fitting holes in the pegbox.  The tip of the pegbox is ornamented with a carved wooden scroll.\u000aThe bridge of a violin has two purposes.  First, it holds the strings in an arched configuration, permitting each to be touched separately by the bow.  The bridge also transmits the sound vibrations of the strings to the belly, from which they are transmitted to the back by the sound post.\u000aGenerally the belly, the sound post, and the bass bar are made of spruce, a light but strong softwood.  The back, ribs, neck, pegbox, scroll, and bridge are of maple, a hardwood.  The choice of woods is basically the same as in the piano, where a hardwood bridge is attached to a spruce soundboard, mounted on a hardwood frame.  \u000aThe fingerboard of a violin is of ebony.  Some old violins have ivory fingerboards.  \u000aStrings were orginally made of gut.  Such strings are still often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier.  However, they have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings, which are made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are also employed today; they combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.  Often, the top E string for a modern viollin is made of steel.\u000aThe hair of the bow is traditionally horse hair, although many cheaper bows use synthetic material.  The hair must be frequently rubbed with rosin in order to grip the strings and cause them to vibrate. \u000a \u000aThe violin is played by using the right hand to draw the bow at right angles across one of the strings, near the bridge, causing the string to vibrate.  Pitch is controlled by selecting the string that the bow contacts (by altering the vertical angle of the bow), and by regulating the sounding length of that string by pressing it down onto the fingerboard with one of the fingers of the left hand.  \u000aThe placement of the fingers on the strings invokes no physical aid like frets; the player must achieve the correct position from skill alone, or else the instrument will sound out of tune.  Violin players practice long hours partly to train their fingers to land in the right places, and partly to cultivate the ability to correct the pitch very rapidly as it is played.\u000aThe fingers are conventionally numbered "first" (index) through "fourth" (little finger).  The digits 1-4 sometimes appear over the notes in violin music, especially in instructional editions, to indicate the finger to be used.\u000aFor the beginning player, the highest note available on a violin is made by pressing the fourth finger down on the E-string, sounding a B. However this is only the highest note in so-called first position, which is taught to beginners first.  A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin (towards the player's face) and pressing the fingers down at this new position.  Thus, for example, in first position, the first finger placed on the E string gives an F#.  Pressing the first finger instead on a G is called second position. Third position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player.  A good player can easily play more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole.   \u000aViolinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary.  Often, this is done to handle a musical passage which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  It is also done to produce a particular timbre:   a violin note will sound different depending on what string is used to play it.  \u000aA special timbre results from playing a note without touching its string with a finger, thus sounding the lowest note on that string.  Such a note is said to played on an open string.  Open string notes (G, D, A, E) have a very distinct sound resulting from absence of the damping action of a finger, and from the fact that vibrato (see below) is impossible.  Other than low G (which can be played in no other way), open strings are usually selected for special effects.\u000aOne striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.\u000aPlaying two open strings simultaneously (that is, double stopped; see below) produces a bagpipe-like drone, often used by composers in imitation of folk music.\u000a \u000aDouble stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.\u000aSee Double stop for general information about the techniques of double stopping and bowing.\u000aWhen a note is marked pizzicato in the written music, it is played by plucking the string with a finger rather than with the bow.  For details of how pizzicato notes are played, see the Wikipedia article "Pizzicato".\u000a \u000aVibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.\u000aIt is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.\u000aPressing the finger very lightly on the string can create harmonics. This means that instead of the normal solid tone a wispy-sounding note of a higher pitch is heard. This is caused by the light finger blocking the string's fundamental; the position of the finger determines the first note of that string's harmonic series which is allowed to sound.\u000aThe tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating as much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  \u000aThe violin produces louder notes when the player either moves the bow faster or pushes down harder on the string.  The two methods are not equivalent, because they produce different timbres; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher, more intense sound.\u000aThe location where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre.  Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a more intense sound than usual, emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound, emphasizing the fundamental frequency.\u000aOccasionally the strings are struck with the back of the bow (col legno).  This gives a much more percussive sound, and is most effective when employed by a full orchestral violin section, since it produces little volume.\u000aA second, more modern percussive technique is called the "chop," in which the hair near the bottom of the bow is struck against the strings.  It is used by some jazz musicians, including the Turtle Island String Quartet.\u000aSee also: How to play the violin \u000a \u000aViolins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.\u000aSmall tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  \u000aThe tuning G-D-A-E is used for the great majority of all violin music.  However, other tunings are occasionally employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A), both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.\u000aViolinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. \u000aIt is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.\u000aIn the course of playing the violin, hairs are often lost from the bow, making it necessary to have it rehaired periodically.\u000aThe violin itself usually does not require maintenance, but it should be occasionally checked by a technician and is regularly cleaned with a gentle polish.\u000a \u000aSince the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity more than any other instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.\u000aThe violin is also considered a very expressive instrument, which is often felt to approximate the human voice.  This may be due to the possibility of vibrato and of slight expressive adjustments in pitch and timbre.\u000aViolins make up a large part of an orchestra, and are usually divided into two sections, known as the first and second violins.  Composers often assign the melody to the first violins (who are often given more technically difficult music), while second violins usually play harmony.  A string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins, as well as viola and cello.\u000aLike many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.\u000aWhen played as a folk instrument, the violin is ordinarily referred to in English as a fiddle; see the Wikipedia article Fiddle for more information on the role of the fiddle in folk music.\u000a* Amati family of Italian violin makers \u000a* Guarneri family of Italian violin makers \u000a* Stradivari family of Italian violin makers\u000aSee violinist.\u000a----\u000a"Violin" is a track from They Might Be Giants' 2002 album No!.\u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a

These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.

VIt is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.

VPressing the finger very lightly on the string can create harmonics. This means that instead of the normal solid tone a wispy-sounding note of a higher pitch is heard. This is caused by the light finger blocking the string's fundamental; the position of the finger determines the first note of that string's harmonic series which is allowed to sound.

VThe tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating as much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  The violin produces louder notes when the player either moves the bow faster or pushes down harder on the string.  The two methods are not equivalent, because they produce different timbres; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher, more intense sound.

VThe location where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre.  Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a more intense sound than usual, emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound, emphasizing the fundamental frequency.

VOccasionally the strings are struck with the back of the bow (col legno).  This gives a much more percussive sound, and is most effective when employed by a full orchestral violin section, since it produces little volume.

VSee also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.

VSmall tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  The tuning G-D-A-E is used for the great majority of all violin music.  However, other tunings are occasionally employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A), both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.

VViolinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.

V Since the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity more than any other instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.

VViolins make up a large part of an orchestra, and are usually divided into two sections, known as the first and second violins.  Composers often assign the melody to the first violins (who are often given more technically difficult music), while second violins usually play harmony.  A string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins, as well as viola and cello.

VLike many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

S'The violin (or fiddle when used in the context of folk music) is a stringed musical instrument comprising 4 strings, each tuned a fifth apart from each other.  The lowest string is a G just below middle C, then D, A and E (in that order).'

S'PositionsThe highest note apparently available on a violin is all four fingers pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in 1st-position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. Pressing the first finger on an F is called going in to 2nd-position. 3rd position is achieved when the first finger presses down on a G. Violinists often do this on the lower strings even though this seems unnecesary. This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.'

S'Double-stopping Double stopping is playing two or more strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places.'

S'Emotional devices Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists, which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato can add much emotion to a piece, as well as disguising a misplaced note.'

S'Pressing the finger very lightly on the string can create harmonics. This means that instead of the normal solid tone a wispy-sounding note of a higher pitch is heard. Maintenance Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs present in the head of a violin. The A-string is tuned first, and other strings tuned in comparison to it using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors. These can adjust the tension of the string and are positioned behind the bridge. These are more convenient when a not a lot of adjustment is necessary.'

S'Strings are relatively cheap to buy and are usually replaced after about a year or when they break. It is said that Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going in to impossibly high positions in order to impress the audience.'

A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to 2nd-position. 3rd position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecesary. This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings."

S"The highest note apparently available on a violin is all four fingers pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in 1st-position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to 2nd-position. 3rd position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecesary. This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings."

S'Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Until around the 18th century, the bow of the violin was bent outwards, making it possible to play on all four strings at the same time. However, with modern bow design, this is not possible, and a player must execute two more more double stops in rapid succession to produce the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop.'

S"The highest note apparently available on a violin is all four fingers pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in 1st-position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to 2nd-position. 3rd position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecesary. This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings."

This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping.  There is a common misconception that the style of bow used until the end of the 18th century was capable of sustained playing on all four strings simultaneously.  However, although the stick of the bow was curved outwards (unlike the modern bow, which is curved inwards), the hair (as with the modern bow) was flat and therefore incapable of sustaining more than two notes at once.  To play three or four note chords, the lower notes are sounded briefly and allowed to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop.  A twentieth century invention called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords;  this design has no historical precedent and is far less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music."

S"The highest note apparently available on a violin is all four fingers pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in 1st-position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to 2nd-position. 3rd position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary. This is done to produce a clearer tone or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping."

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three  notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'As well as the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge (over which the violin strings are stretched) is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some fiddles the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).'

S'Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists, which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to add much emotion to a piece. A useful side effect is that it can disguise an out of tune note.'

S'The violin (or fiddle when used in the context of folk music) is a stringed musical instrument comprising 4 strings, each tuned a fifth apart from each other.  The lowest string is a G just below middle C, then D, A and E (in that order).  Occasionally other tunings are employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A) both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.'

S'Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists, which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to add much emotion to a piece. A useful side effect is that it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are, in fact, several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'The tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating so much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  Another way to vary the tone of the instrument is to move the bow nearer to or further away from the bridge.  Playing up close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a thinner, harsher sound than usual, and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound.'

S'Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs present in the head of a violin. The A-string is tuned first, typically to A440. The other strings are then tuned in comparison to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (or fine tuners). These can adjust the tension of the string and are positioned behind the bridge. These are more convenient when a not a lot of adjustment is necessary. They are also much easier to use, as the pegs in the head have the nasty habit of slipping, and need to be set in a turning and pushing method. Adjustors are recommended for younger players. Small tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string.  Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Strings are usually replaced after about a year or when they break. The cost of strings can vary very widely, and the quality of strings can have a big impact on the timbre of the sound produced. Strings made of gut, which are often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier, have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are a convenient modern alternative, which combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.'

S"The highest note apparently available on a violin is the little finger pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in first position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and presssing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to second position. Third position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary. This is done to produce a particular timbre or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping."

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three  notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three  notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

Occasionally other tunings are employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A) both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.'

S"The highest note apparently available on a violin is the little finger pressed down on the E-string (sounding a B). However this is only the highest note in first position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin and pressing the fingers down at this new position. In 1st position, the first finger on the E string gives an F or F#.  Pressing the first finger on a G is called going in to second position. Third position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player, and a good player could easily get more than 2 octaves out of each string.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary. This is done to produce a particular timbre or to handle a piece which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be coordinated on to different strings simultaneously. Sometimes going in to higher positions is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping."

S'The violin (or fiddle when used in the context of folk music) is a stringed musical instrument comprising four strings tuned a fifth apart. It is the smallest and highest-tuned member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola, cello and double bass. The lowest string (and hence the lowest note) is the G just below middle C, then in ascending order D, A and E. Occasionally other tunings are employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A) both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.'

S' Sheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). The violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. A person who plays violin is called a violinist. The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across a delicate wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard to the scroll, where they are wound around their tuning pegs.  The purpose of the bridge is to hold the strings in an arched configuration permitting each to be touched separately by the bow.  The bridge also transmits the sound vibrations of the strings to the belly, from which they are transmitted to the back by the sound post.'

S"For the beginning player, the highest note available on a violin is made by pressing the fourth finger down on the E-string, sounding a B. However this is only the highest note in first position. A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin (towards the player's face) and pressing the fingers down at this new position.  Thus, for example, in first position, the first finger placed on the E string gives an F#.  Pressing the first finger instead on a G is called second position. Third position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player.  A good player can easily play more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary.  Often, this is done to handle a musical passage which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  It is also done to produce a particular timbre:   a violin note will sound different depending on what string is used to play it.   Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping."

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'The tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating as much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  Another way to vary the tone of the instrument is to move the bow nearer to or further away from the bridge.  Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a thinner, harsher sound than usual, and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Small tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  Strings are usually replaced after about a year of use or when they break. The cost of strings can vary very widely, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. Strings made of gut, which are often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier, have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are a convenient modern alternative, which combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.  Often, the top E string is made of steel.'

S' Since the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity perhaps more than any instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.'

The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S'When a note is marked "pizzicato" in the music, it is played by plucking the string with a finger rather than with the bow.  Usually the player holds the bow with all but the index finger, and uses the index finger to pluck.  In long pizzicato passages a player will sometimes put the bow down for convenience.  Occasionally, a work will call for left-hand pizzicato, generally executed with the fourth finger.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'The tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating as much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  Another way to vary the tone of the instrument is to move the bow nearer to or further away from the bridge.  Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a harsher sound than usual, emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound, emphasizing the fundamental.'

S' Since the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity more than any other instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.'

S' Sheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). The violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. A person who plays violin is called a violinist. The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The sides of the violin, curiously, are called ribs.  The belly is reinforced by an internal bass bar, which runs vertically through the instrument underneath the lowest string.  The four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across an intricately carved wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard to the scroll, where they are wound around their tuning pegs.  The purpose of the bridge is to hold the strings in an arched configuration permitting each to be touched separately by the bow.  The bridge also transmits the sound vibrations of the strings to the belly, from which they are transmitted to the back by the sound post.'

S' The violin is played by using the right hand to draw the bow across one of the strings, near the bridge, causing the string to vibrate.  Pitch is controlled by selecting the string that the bow contacts (that is, by angling the bow appropriately), and by regulating the sounding length of a string by pressing the string down onto the fingerboard with one of the fingers of the left hand.   The placement of the fingers on the strings invokes no physical aid like frets; the player must achieve the correct position from skill alone, or else the instrument will sound out of tune.  Violin players practice long hours partly to train their fingers to land in the right places, and partly to cultivate the ability to correct the pitch very rapidly as it is played.'

S' Sheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). The violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. A person who plays violin is called a violinist. The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The sides of the violin, curiously, are called ribs.  The belly is reinforced by an internal bass bar, which runs vertically through the instrument underneath the lowest string.  The four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across an intricately carved wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard.  At the top end of the fingerboard, the strings cross the nut, a very small second bridge, mounted just slightly above the fingerboard.  They then enter the pegbox, where they are wound around their tuning pegs, which are mounted sideways through tightly fitting holes in the pegbox.  The tip of the pegbox is ornamented with a carved wooden scroll.'

The choice of woods is basically the same as in the piano, where a hardwood bridge is attached to a spruce soundboard, mounted on a hardwood frame.  The fingerboard of a violin is of ebony.  Some old violins have ivory fingerboards.  For the materials of the strings and bow, see below.'

S"For the beginning player, the highest note available on a violin is made by pressing the fourth finger down on the E-string, sounding a B. However this is only the highest note in so-called first position, which is taught to beginners first.  A higher note can be achieved by sliding the hand up the neck of the violin (towards the player's face) and pressing the fingers down at this new position.  Thus, for example, in first position, the first finger placed on the E string gives an F#.  Pressing the first finger instead on a G is called second position. Third position is achieved when the first finger presses down on an A, and so on.  The upper limit of the violin's range is largely determined by the skill of the player.  A good player can easily play more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole.   Violinists often change positions on the lower strings even though this seems unnecessary.  Often, this is done to handle a musical passage which would otherwise require fast switching of strings.  It is also done to produce a particular timbre:   a violin note will sound different depending on what string is used to play it.  A special timbre results from playing a note without touching its string with a finger, thus sounding the lowest note on that string.  Such a note is said to played on an open string.  Open string notes (G, D, A, E) have a very distinct sound resulting from absence of the damping action of a finger, and from the fact that vibrato (see below) is impossible.  Other than low G (which can be played in no other way), open strings are usually selected for special effects."

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'The tone of the violin can also be altered by attaching a small device called a mute to the bridge of the instrument. This stops the bridge itself from vibrating as much, and causes a more mellow tone, with fewer audible harmonics above the note being played.  Another way to vary the tone of the instrument is to move the bow nearer to or further away from the bridge.  Playing close to the bridge (sul ponticello) gives a harsher sound than usual, emphasizing the higher harmonics; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard (sul tasto) makes for a delicate, ethereal sound, emphasizing the fundamental.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Small tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  Strings are usually replaced after about a year of use or when they break. The cost of strings can vary very widely, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. Strings made of gut, which are often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier, have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are a convenient modern alternative, which combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.  Often, the top E string is made of steel.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Small tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  Strings are usually replaced after about a year of use or when they break. The cost of strings can vary very widely, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. Strings made of gut, which are often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier, have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are a convenient modern alternative, which combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.  Often, the top E string is made of steel.'

S' The violin is played by using the right hand to draw the bow at right angles across one of the strings, near the bridge, causing the string to vibrate.  Pitch is controlled by selecting the string that the bow contacts (by altering the vertical angle of the bow), and by regulating the sounding length of that string by pressing it down onto the fingerboard with one of the fingers of the left hand.  The placement of the fingers on the strings invokes no physical aid like frets; the player must achieve the correct position from skill alone, or else the instrument will sound out of tune.  Violin players practice long hours partly to train their fingers to land in the right places, and partly to cultivate the ability to correct the pitch very rapidly as it is played.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Small tuning adjustments can also be made by stretching a string with the hand.  Strings are usually replaced after about a year of use or when they break. The cost of strings can vary very widely, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. Strings made of gut, which are often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier, have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings made from metal.  Synthetic cored strings (wound with metal) are a convenient modern alternative, which combine some of the benefits of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability.  Often, the top E string is made of steel.'

S'The violin (or fiddle when used in the context of folk music) is a stringed musical instrument comprising four strings tuned a fifth apart. It is the smallest and highest-tuned member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola, cello and double bass. The lowest string (and hence the lowest note) is the G just below middle C, then in ascending order D, A and E.  Sheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). The violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. A person who plays violin is called a violinist.  Since the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity more than any other instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.'

S'The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The sides of the violin, curiously, are called ribs.  The belly is reinforced by an internal bass bar, which runs vertically through the instrument underneath the lowest string.  The four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across an intricately carved wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard.  At the top end of the fingerboard, the strings cross the nut, a very small second bridge, mounted just slightly above the fingerboard.  They then enter the pegbox, where they are wound around their tuning pegs, which are mounted sideways through tightly fitting holes in the pegbox.  The tip of the pegbox is ornamented with a carved wooden scroll.'

The choice of woods is basically the same as in the piano, where a hardwood bridge is attached to a spruce soundboard, mounted on a hardwood frame.  The fingerboard of a violin is of ebony.  Some old violins have ivory fingerboards.  Strings were orginally made of gut.  Such strings are still often used in historically accurate performances of music from the 18th century and earlier.  However, they have a tendency to go out of tune and snap more easily than modern strings, which are made from metal.

S'The hair of the bow is traditionally horse hair, although many cheaper bows use synthetic material.  The hair must be frequently rubbed with rosin in order to grip the strings and cause them to vibrate.  The violin is played by using the right hand to draw the bow at right angles across one of the strings, near the bridge, causing the string to vibrate.  Pitch is controlled by selecting the string that the bow contacts (by altering the vertical angle of the bow), and by regulating the sounding length of that string by pressing it down onto the fingerboard with one of the fingers of the left hand.  The placement of the fingers on the strings invokes no physical aid like frets; the player must achieve the correct position from skill alone, or else the instrument will sound out of tune.  Violin players practice long hours partly to train their fingers to land in the right places, and partly to cultivate the ability to correct the pitch very rapidly as it is played.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'The violin is a stringed musical instrument comprising four strings tuned a fifth apart. It is the smallest and highest-tuned member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola, cello and double bass. The lowest string (and hence the lowest note) is the G just below middle C, then in ascending order D, A and E.  Sheet music for a violin almost always uses the G clef (treble clef). The violin has some similarities to the earlier viol family of instruments. A person who plays violin is called a violinist. The violin is a carefully made hollow wooden box, with a neck protruding from the top, and a internal sound post connecting the front (belly) and the back.  The sides of the violin, curiously, are called ribs.  The belly is reinforced by an internal bass bar, which runs vertically through the instrument underneath the lowest string.  The four strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base of the violin, across an intricately carved wooden bridge, then upward just above the fingerboard.  At the top end of the fingerboard, the strings cross the nut, a very small second bridge, mounted just slightly above the fingerboard.  They then enter the pegbox, where they are wound around their tuning pegs, which are mounted sideways through tightly fitting holes in the pegbox.  The tip of the pegbox is ornamented with a carved wooden scroll.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S' Since the Baroque era the violin has one of the most important of all instruments in classical music, for several reasons.  The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line.  In the hands of a good player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes.  Indeed, the violin seems to lend itself to virtuosity more than any other instrument (its only plausible rival is the piano), and top violinists have amazed their audiences with their wizardry since the 17th century.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note, though a listener with absolute pitch will notice such a technique quite easily.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'Violins make up a large part of an orchestra, and are usually divided into two sections, known as the first and second violins.  Composers often assign the melody to the first violins, while second violins usually play harmony.  A string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins, as well as viola and cello.  In primary and secondary school orchestras, the first violins often play more technically difficult music, and there is some prestige associated with this part.'

Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time. However, most treatises written around the time make it clear that composers did not expect three notes to be played at once, even though the notes may be written in a way as to suggest this, and playing four notes at once is almost impossible even with older bows. The normal way of playing three or four note chords is to briefly sound the lower notes and allow them to ring while the bow plays the upper notes.  This gives the illusion of a true triple or quadruple stop. A twentieth century invention by Emil Telm\xc3\xa1nyi called the Bach bow makes use of a system of levers to temporarily slacken the bow hair and allow sustained three or four note chords; this design has no historical precedent and is less authentic than an ordinary modern bow for playing baroque (or any other) music.'

S'In addition to the style of bow, the curvature of the bridge is an important factor in the ease of multiple stopping. On most classical instruments, the bridge is curved enough to make it difficult to play three strings at once, but on some violins the bridge is shaved down until almost flat, making it far easier to triple stop, as well as to alternate double stopping on different pairs of strings (D-A to A-E for example).  The compensating disadvantage is that more skill is needed to avoid playing a double stop when none is called for.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  A useful side effect of vibrato, is that (at least to a limited extent) it can disguise an out of tune note.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'The style of bow used until around the end of the 18th century, particularly in Germany, had the wood curved outwards, which made it somewhat easier to play three notes at the same time.

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

However, other tunings are occasionally employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A), both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'It is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'It is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'It is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

S'Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used by ordinary people for the purpose of playing folk music.  Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well.  As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas.'

S'The bridge of a violin has two purposes.  First, it holds the strings in an arched configuration, permitting each to be touched separately by the bow.  The bridge also transmits the sound vibrations of the strings to the belly, from which they are transmitted to the back by the sound post.'

S'One striking effect that employs open strings is barriolage.  Here, the player fingers the same note of an open string (necessarily D, A, or E) on the immediately lower string, then moves the bow with a rapid snake-like motion that causes it to touch the fingered string and the open string alternatingly.  The same pitch is thus sounded, but the different timbres of an open string vs. a fingered string produce an audible rhythmic pulsation.  Barriolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the "Farewell" Symphony.'

S' Double stopping is playing two strings simultaneously, producing a chord. This is much harder than normal single-string playing as more than one finger has to be accurately placed on two different strings simultaneously. Sometimes moving to a higher position is necessary in order for it to be physically possible for the fingers to be placed in the correct places. Double stopping is also used to mean playing on three or all four strings at once, although such practices are more properly called triple or quadruple stopping. Collectively, double, triple and quadruple stopping is called multiple stopping.'

S' Vibrato is a very common device used by violinists which causes the pitch of a note to vary up and down quickly. This is achieved by moving the finger pressing on the string slightly forwards and backwards. Vibrato is often perceived to create a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the Romantic era.  There are several different styles of vibrato ranging from the use of just the fingers, to the use of the wrist or even the whole forearm.  These produce different effects and are favoured by different players for different styles of music.  Some styles of music use little or no vibrato at all.'

S'It is often thought that vibrato can partially disguise an out of tune note, the intuitive idea being that the ear should not be able track pitch as accurately when it is moving up and down.  However, recent [http://lib.hut.fi/Diss/2003/isbn9512263149/article5.pdf experimental work] finds no such effect:  the human ear detects the mean frequency of a vibrato note just as accurately as it detects a non-undulating pitch.  It is not necessarily the case that results obtained under careful experimental conditions will carry over to real-life playing, and there is at least some evidence that vibrato may be able to disguise mistuning at faster tempos.  Nevertheless, it now appears that individuals learning to play the violin are well advised never to suppose that using vibrato will help them with their pitch problems.'

S'See also: How to play the violin  Violins are tuned by twisting the pegs in the scroll, around which the strings are wrapped. The A string is tuned first, typically to 440 Hz (see Pitch (music)). The other strings are then tuned to it in intervals of perfect fifths using double-stopping. Some violins also have adjustors (also called fine tuners). These permits the tension of the string to be adjusted by rotating a small knob.  Such tuning is generally easier than using the pegs, and adjustors are usually recommended for younger players. Adjustors work best, and are most useful, with higher tension metal strings.  It is very common to use one on the E-string even if the others are not equipped with them.'

However, other tunings are occasionally employed (for example, tuning the G string up to A), both in classical music (where the technique is known as scordatura) and in some folk styles.'

S'Violinists carry replacement strings with their instruments to have one available in case a string breaks.  All four replacement strings must be included, since they differ in thickness.  Even the strings which do not break are usually replaced after about a year of use.  The cost of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. It is said that Niccolo Paganini purposefully weakened some of his strings so that in performance they would snap. He would then play the rest of the piece on the remaining strings, sometimes going into remarkably high positions in order to impress the audience.'
