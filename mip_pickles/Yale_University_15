VYale University, one of eight Ivy League universities, was founded in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, U.S.A. in 1701 by Congregationalist ministers. It moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716. The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city's largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents.\u000aThe college's original name was the "Collegiate School"; it was renamed "Yale" after an early benefactor, Elihu Yale.\u000aIn the early 20th century, Yale merged with the Sheffield Scientific School.\u000aIn addition to a respected undergraduate college, Yale is noted for its law school, medical school, and school of music.

S"Yale University, one of eight Ivy League universities, was founded in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, U.S.A. in 1701 by Congregationalist ministers. It moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1716. The Yale campus is in downtown New Haven, and the university is one of the city's largest employers, which sometimes leads to tension between students and local residents."
